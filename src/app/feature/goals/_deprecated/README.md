# Deprecations

2020-11-15 (Chris)

The reminders module has had a number of significant refactors and in it's currently state
still has a certain amount of legacy and deprecated code.

It is currently being retained as is likely to be required in the future when including
additional push notification features.

As some other modules were also requiring the reminders service it has now also been moved
to the shared services directory
