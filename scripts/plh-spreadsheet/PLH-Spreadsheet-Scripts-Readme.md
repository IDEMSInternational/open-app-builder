# PLH Spreadsheet Scripts

The script inside this folder is for converting the app content spreadsheet into JSON files that are interpreted by the app.

An example of the input spreadsheet can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_XxVqVmHDZ_TL7KOrl9OIlfPVpJM9wO/view?usp=sharing

This input spreadsheet has a Content_List sheet which acts as an index / table of contents which is used to describe the other sheets.

The other sheets are of two types
- Conversation: For character / guide conversations
- Toolbox: For toolbox content

Conversation sheets are converted into a Rapid Pro Flow Export JSON file by the **ConversastionTranslator** class.

Toolbox sheets are converted into a single JSON file by the **ToolboxTranslator** class
