# Angular

- Prefer standalone components, directives, and pipes over NgModules
- Use signals for state management instead of BehaviorSubjects where appropriate
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for components
- Leverage the new Angular control flow syntax (if/switch/for) instead of structural directives
- Use functional guards and resolvers instead of classes
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into services or standalone functions
