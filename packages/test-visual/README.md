# Test Visual

Visual regression testing tools to compare screenshots taken from within the current app platform with those generated in a previous release

## Compare screenshots
Compare screenshots of the current local repo with 

1. Ensure the local app server is running
`yarn start`

2. Run screenshot comparison script
`yarn workspace test-visual start compare --clean`

Output will be updated as screenshots are produced, and image diffs populated to folder
```
{
  "new": 0,
  "different": 412,
  "same": 464
}
```



## Manually populating screenshots
### v0.12+
(WiP docs - to confirm use of gh action or alts)

### older versions
As these scripts were not available to earlier versions process will involve
1. Download release source code from repo, e.g. https://github.com/IDEMSInternational/parenting-app-ui/releases
2. Extract to `cache/releases` folder, 
3. setup environment/config as required
4. Run app src from extracted folder (`yarn start`)
5. Run generate scripts from this repo (`yarn workspace test-visual start -- generate --clean`)
6. Manually edit release to upload generated `screenshots.zip`


## Developers
All CLI scripts can be used with the `dev` yarn script to add watch and live-reload, e.g.
```
`yarn workspace test-visual dev -- generate`
```
Note - depending on commander and files updated, live reload may not always work (requires further investigation)
