1
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:09,549
When everything feels like it is falling apart

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,901
And you can't help but raise your voice

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:14,794
When all the frustrations are beginning to start

4
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,343
Remember that you have a choice

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,890
Let's slow down

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,052
Take a few deep breaths

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,983
Remember all we have to be grateful for

8
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:31,146
Let's slow down

9
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:34,240
Take a few deep breaths

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,909
Because I really couldn't love you more

11
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,410
You can take pause, you can count to 10

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,210
Play a game or do something fun

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,040
You can phone a friend, someone to confide in

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,227
Remember you're not the only one

15
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:56,558
Let's slow down

16
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,520
Take a few deep breaths

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,408
Remember all we have to be grateful for

18
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,779
Let's slow down

19
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,444
Take a few deep breaths

20
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:15,464
Because I really couldn't love you more

21
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,940
Let's slow down

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,579
Take a few deep breaths

23
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:27,344
Remember all we have to be grateful for

24
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:29,851
Let's slow down

25
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:33,011
Take a few deep breaths

26
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:37,763
Because I really couldn't love you more

27
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:43,544
Because I really couldn't love you more
