00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:09.549
When everything feels like it is falling apart

2
00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.901
And you can't help but raise your voice

3
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:14.794
When all the frustrations are beginning to start

4
00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.343
Remember that you have a choice

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.890
Let's slow down

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.052
Take a few deep breaths

7
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:27.983
Remember all we have to be grateful for

8
00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.146
Let's slow down

9
00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:34.240
Take a few deep breaths

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.909
Because I really couldn't love you more

11
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.410
You can take pause, you can count to 10

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.210
Play a game or do something fun

13
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.040
You can phone a friend, someone to confide in

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.227
Remember you're not the only one

15
00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.558
Let's slow down

16
00:00:56.558 --> 00:00:59.520
Take a few deep breaths

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.408
Remember all we have to be grateful for

18
00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.779
Let's slow down

19
00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:10.444
Take a few deep breaths

20
00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:15.464
Because I really couldn't love you more

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.940
Let's slow down

22
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.579
Take a few deep breaths

23
00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:27.344
Remember all we have to be grateful for

24
00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:29.851
Let's slow down

25
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:33.011
Take a few deep breaths

26
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:37.763
Because I really couldn't love you more

27
00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:43.544
Because I really couldn't love you more
