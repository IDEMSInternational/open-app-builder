Look at the person you are throwing it to.  \n* The direction (up, down, straight, curved, rolling the ground) and force (hard, soft, medium) that you throw the snap should affect how the person catches it.  \n* You can bounce the “snap”, throw it in the air, and catch it a few times before passing it.  \n* When everyone gets good at this, you can start moving around the room, still passing the “snap”.  \n* Can you throw under the leg? Behind the back? Through your head? Intercept a pass? Have fun with the “snap”!",
