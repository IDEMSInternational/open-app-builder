It also will be a big help in getting started with multiplication.\n\nAlthough skip counting is not the fastest way to find a result, it is reliable. Suppose your child needs to find 7 x 3. Do this by skip counting by 3’s seven times or skip counting by 7’s three times.\n\nYour child will eventually memorize these facts, but skip counting is a handy method for now.",
