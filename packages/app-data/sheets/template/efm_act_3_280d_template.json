Although the official games are played on a 19 by 19 rectangular grid of points, a 13 by 13 grid produced by 13 horizontal and vertical lines should work well.\n\nPlayers take turns placing their tokens on grid points - you can use raisins and cheerios, or any other tokens you have lots of. The first player to get five of their tokens in a row wins.",
