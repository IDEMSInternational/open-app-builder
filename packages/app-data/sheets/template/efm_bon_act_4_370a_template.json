This involves two challenges - finding out which sums will work and then figuring out how to get those sums. It is better to let your child play with this to figure out which sums are possible, but if frustration wins out, the possible sums are 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nIf your child enjoys figuring this out, this can be done for larger triangles as well. For a triangle with nine circles with four circles on a side, the possible sums are 17, 19, 20, 21, and 23.\n\nAs with so many of the puzzles for this age group, the main reason to have your child play with this is to encourage having fun exploring how numbers interact with each other and to practice number facts. They do not yet have the math or reasoning skills to be systematic with their exploration. However, these puzzles can be explored more deeply, and here are some ideas to dig into if you or an older child are interested.\n\nLet SUM represent the sum of one side of the triangle. If you add up the three sides of the triangle, the total will be 3 x SUM. However, the total of the three sides will also be the sum of all the numbers plus one extra copy for each corner of the triangle. Let C-SUM be the sum of the values in the three corners. We end up with the relationship that 3 x SUM = (Total of all the numbers) + C-SUM.",

          "value": "Apply this to the triangle with six circles. The sum of all the numbers is the sum of the numbers from one to six, which is 21. So the equation becomes 3 x SUM = 21 + C-SUM The smallest C-SUM can be is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the largest it can be is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So, 3 x SUM is between 21 + 6 = 27 and 21 + 15 = 36. This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n\nAnother thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n\nThe last thing to notice before we dig in with actual numbers is that for any solution for the three corners, we can assume that they are in increasing order going around clockwise, with the smallest number at the top. If they are not in that configuration to begin with, you can rotate or flip the diagram until they are.\n\nAll these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order. If SUM is 9, then C-SUM = 3 x 9 - 21 = 6, so the trio is 1, 2, and 3. If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9. This leaves two possibilities - either corner values of 1, 2, and 6, or 1, 3, and 5. A quick trial rules out 1, 2, and 6 as a possibility.\n\nAfter much work, we have the solutions for SUM being 9 and 10 for the six circle puzzle. Remember that you can get the solutions for SUM being 11 and 12 by subtracting all the entries from 7.",
