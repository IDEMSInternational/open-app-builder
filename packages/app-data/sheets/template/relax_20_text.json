Stretch to the front and to the back.\n\nLet your hands hang by your side. Squeeze your shoulders tightly up to your ears as you breathe in, scrunch your eyes, and hold your breath. Release your shoulders as you relax your body.\n\nRelax your arms and let them swing sideways while you turn your upper body. Your arms should gently hit your back as you twist from side to side.\n\nPlace one foot in front of the other and make small circles from your ankles - remember to turn to both sides. Do each foot with four circles in each direction.\n\nNow shake your whole body as fast as you can. Shake it up high! Shake it down low! Shake it all around!\n\nClose your eyes and raise your arms slowly above your head as you breathe in. Lower your arms slowly to your side as you breathe out.\n\nTake a moment to reflect on your experience.",
