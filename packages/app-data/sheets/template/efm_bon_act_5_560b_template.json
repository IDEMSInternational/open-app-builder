Here are some ideas to think about.\n\n**Rule** Always pick a number that is a power of 2 times a number from 1 to 20.\n\nIf you pick a number such as 23 or 46, they can never be hit and you are guaranteed to lose.\n\n**Rule** Never pick a number that is twice another number you could have picked but didn’t.\n\nIf you pick 44, why not pick 22 instead? If the other person picks 22, you will miss a round.\n\n**Further analysis** The numbers from 1 to 20 are equally likely to be picked. However, because 9 leads to 18, 18 is twice as likely as a starting point than say 11 is. If you combine the ways to get different starts, the starting points have the following probabilities:\n\n11 - 1/20 (from 11)\n12 - 3/20 (from 3, 6, and 12)\n13 - 1/20 (from 13)\n14 - 2/20 (from 7 and 14)\n15 - 1/20 (from 15)\n16 - 5/20 (from 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16)\n17 - 1/20 (from 17)\n18 - 2/20 (from 9 and 18)\n19 - 1/20 (from 19)\n20 - 3/20 (from 5, 10, and 20)\n\nClearly the best numbers to use are multiples of 16, 12, and 20. A simple strategy is to use the five numbers: 32, 64, 24, 48, and 40. These numbers will not always win, but they should do very well for you over time.",
