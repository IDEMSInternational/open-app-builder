Try not to call it ‘sleep’ or ‘a trip away’.  \n- Older teens may understand what death is, but they may struggle to share or handle their emotions.  \n- Teens can respond in very different ways: crying, shouting, not believing or going very quiet. All of these are okay. Tell them that you are there with them. \n- Allow questions and talking. Be honest. It is okay to say when we don’t know.",
