While the value in a circle may or may not duplicate the value in some other circle or shape, the value in a non-circular shape must match the value in all other places with the same shape. For example, all squares have the same value. Use matching shapes to practice adding twins, near twins, and halving. \n\nIf you like, you can add the rule that two non-circular shapes that have different shapes must have different values - for example, a square and a hexagon would have to have different values.\n\nMake any of these puzzles by starting with a diagram that is completely filled in and then removing some numbers. If the puzzle has some repeated numbers, use a square or other shape instead of a circle for that repeated number.\n\nThe next two puzzles illustrate the psychological difference between using a circle from two directions and replacing the circle with two squares. These two puzzles are essentially the same, but a young child will find the first one much easier to understand and work with. Please give your child plenty of practice with circle-only puzzles before venturing into more sophisticated puzzles with non-circular shapes.",
