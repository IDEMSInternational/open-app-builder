      "pest_description": "False codling moth ( Cryptophlebia leucotreta )   \n\tThe false codling moth is small (wingspan of 16 - 20 mm), dark brown to grey in colour. The moths are active at night. Female moths lay single eggs mostly on the fruit. After emerging from the egg, the young caterpillar tunnels into the fruit and the fruit sap thus liberated forms a typical white crystalline excrescence on the surface of the fruit. When moths lay eggs on young fruits the caterpillars usually die and thus large caterpillars are seldom found. \n\tHowever, the caterpillars are able to develop if fruits are approaching maturity when infested. The young caterpillar is creamy-white with a dark brownish head. With age the body turns pinkish red. The fully-grown caterpillar is 15 to 20 mm in length. When mature the caterpillar leaves the fruit and pupates in the soil or beneath surface debris.",

Honeydew attracts ants, which while feeding on the honeydew protect scales from natural enemies. Armoured scales such as the coconut scale ( Aspidiotus destructor ) may encrust young twigs, leaves and fruit. They do not produce honeydew. Scales are usually not a problem in avocado orchards; however, damage can be serious on young tress and small twigs may be killed.

Helopeltis  bugs  also known as tea mosquito or mired bug are slender, delicate bugs, about 7- 10 mm long and have long legs and antenna. The females are red and the males are brown to yellowish red. The bugs prefer to feed on young plant tissue piercing the shoots, stems, leaves peduncles, petioles and fruits. Their feeding causes brown necrotic patches. Attacked leaves present angular lesion, which often drop out leaving holes as it attacked by biting insects. Feeding on young shoots causes dieback of the shoots. Feeding on fruits causes first a dark water-soaked mark around the feeding puncture, turning into a lesion with a light brown centre and black edge. The fruit may exude sap that forms a whitish deposit as it dries. Stink bugs  are shield-shaped bugs variable in size (6 to 15 mm long) and colour (green to brown or reddish brown).

Root-knot nematodes prefer warm temperatures and are likely to become established in potato crops grown in relatively warm areas. Generally, they are not a major problem in cool climate potato production areas, but can become a problem when potatoes are grown intensively or rotated with other susceptible crops. Infested potato plants may show varying degrees of stunting, yellowing of leaves and a tendency to wilt under moisture stress. Roots have swellings or galls. Affected tubers have blisters or swellings. On potato tubers, galls may or may not be produced on the tuber surface, depending on  cultivar s. When galls are produced, they appear as small, raised lumps above giving the skin a rough appearance. Galls may be grouped in a single area or scattered near the tuber eyes. Infestations are difficult to detect in freshly harvested potato tubers. Symptoms  may develop when tubers are stored, particularly when taken to warmer climates where nematode numbers can rapidly increase. Symptoms are most severe when crops are grown on sandy soils and warm climates above 25 degC. Nematode attack reduces the quality, size and number of tubers. Root-knot nematode infested potatoes can become more susceptible to bacterial wilt, and symptoms are more severe when plants are also infected with fungal pathogens such as  Verticillium  and  Rhizoctonia . Root-knot nematodes are mainly spread in potato tubers and in infested soil. Egg masses may be transported into clean fields via soil adhering to farm machinery.

Monitoring of aphid build-up is important.;Protect young plants from aphid attack. Virus spread early in the season is more serious than later on, as young plants are generally more susceptible. Moreover, plants that are infected early become more efficient sources for further virus spread than plants infected later in the season.;Harvest seed potatoes no later than 8 to 10 days after a critical aphid build-up or increased virus infection rates are noted. This may help to avoid infection since the virus requires time to infect the tubers after a virus-carrying aphid has fed on potato foliage.;Remove yellow flowering weeds and any other host plants within and around the field. Aphids are attracted to yellow colour.;Protect potato tubers during storage by preventing access of aphids. Potato aphids readily colonise tuber sprouts. Seed potatoes are very susceptible to infection at this stage.;Neem products are useful for reducing aphid populations on potatoes.

The major hosts of  G. rostochiensis  are crops in Solanaceae family, potato, tomato, eggplant and solanaceous weeds. PCN are microscopic worms that attack plant roots. The eggs hatch in the soil, juvenile nematodes move to, penetrate and feed on the host roots. After mating, fertilized eggs develop inside females that are attached to roots. When the females die, their skin hardens and becomes a protective brown cover (cyst) around the eggs. Each cyst contains hundreds of eggs, and can remain viable for many years in the absence of host plants. One generation normally occurs during one growing season. At flowering or later stages of the host plant, mature females and cysts can be seen by the naked eye as tiny round objects (about 0.5 mm, the size of a pinhead) on the root surface. Potato cyst nematode is spread by wind, run off water, farm equipment, animals, clothing/foot ware. Symptoms of attack include patches of poor growth, severe stunting, yellowing, wilting and reduced size of potato tubers.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Plant certified potato seeds;Avoid planting potatoes for up to 7 years in infested fields.;Practice crop rotation;Trap crop;ping - planting a crop of potato to stimulate the eggs to hatch and then removing the plant before the nematodes can complete their life cycle.",

      "pest_title": "Potato tuber moth ( Phthorimaea operculella )",
      "pest_description": "Potato tuber moth ( Phthorimaea operculella )   This moth is the most serious pest of potatoes in the region. It occurs in Africa wherever potatoes are grown, and it also attacks tobacco, eggplants and tomatoes. The moth is small (measuring about one mm at rest and with 12 to 16 mm wingspan), brownish grey in colour with narrow fringed wings. The moths are active mainly at dusk, but occasionally they can be seen flying within potato plants. Female moths lay eggs singly or in small batches on sheltered places of the foliage (leaf and stems) and near the eye buds on exposed tubers through cracks in the soil or in the store.   The caterpillars are up to 12 mm long and whitish to pale greenish in colour. They feed as leafminers between the upper and the lower epidermis and bore into the petiole, or a young shoot or main leaf vein and later into the tuber. When eggs are laid on tubers, caterpillars begin feeding on the tubers immediately upon hatching. They pupate in a silken cocoon covered with soil particles and debris among dead potato leaves, soil litter, eyes of tubers, and storage walls and floors.   Caterpillars burrowing in the tubers cause major damage by making long irregular black tunnels filled with excreta, where disease-causing  microorganism s grow. These tunnels provide an entry point for various plant pathogens and make the potatoes unfit for human consumption. The pest is transferred with the harvested tubers to the potato store, where it can reproduce and infest other tubers. This may lead to total destruction of the stored crop.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Conserve natural enemies. They are important for natural control of the potato tuber moth. Ladybird beetles prey on eggs and young caterpillars. Larvae of lacewings, big-eyed bugs, ground beetles, earwigs and rove beetles prey on all stages of the pest. Several native parasitic wasps attack this pest.;A granulosis;virus has also been found infecting caterpillars in the field (diseased caterpillars have a milky white colouration and are sluggish). However, in many cases control is not satisfactory, therefore several parasitic wasps, native from South America, the area of origin of the pest, have been introduced to several countries in Africa. The most important are;Copidosoma koehleri;and;Apanteles subandinus;. These wasps have provided effective control of the pests in several countries, particularly in Southern and Eastern Africa;Use healthy, clean seed, since infested seed tubers are the main cause of re-infestation in the field.;Avoid planting in rough soil. Plant as deeply as possible (10 cm deep) and ridge at least 3 times during the growing season. Experiments in Sudan showed that increasing the sowing depth from 2.5 cm practised by farmers to 7.6 cm, significantly reduced damage by the cutworms and the potato tuber moth and resulted in an increase of 3.7 t/ha in marketable yield (Siddig, 1987).;Ensure compact hilling. This is very important to prevent moths reaching the tubers to lay eggs. It also makes it difficult for caterpillars to reach the tubers. In addition, emerging moths from infested tubers will not be able to emerge through deep soil.;Provide enough water to prevent soil cracks.;Mulch the plants with rice straw and/or with leaves. Mulching with neem leaves during the last 4 weeks before harvest significantly reduced insect damage in Sudan. (Ali, 1993).;Intercrop potatoes with hot pepper, onions or peas.;Harvest the crop immediately as it matures, as tubers left in fields for longer periods are highly infested.;At harvesting, ensure that the tubers are not exposed to moths before they are properly protected in the store. All harvested tubers have to be bagged and removed before late afternoon every day.;Destroy all infested potatoes immediately and remove all plant residues from the field. Caterpillars pupate in the tubers and dry stems left in the field.;Destroy all volunteer potato plants before planting new potato crops.;Use alternative pesticides to protect potatoes in store.;Neem can be applied to reduce damage by the potato tuber moth. For instance, in India a four months protection was achieved when harvested potatoes and the covering material were sprayed with five and 10% enriched neem seed extract (Saxena, 1995). In Sudan spraying neem seed and leaf extracts (1 kg/40 l water) and then placing tubers in jute sacks reduced post harvest losses by the potato tuber moth compared with traditional methods such as leaving the tuber unprotected or covering them with banana leaves only (Siddig, 1987). A neem seed extract was also effective for control of the potato tuber moth on stored potatoes in Egypt (Salem, 1991) . Storage loss after 6 months in potatoes treated with 100ppm neem oil was 25% (compared to 10% with the insecticide carbaryl). Adults from larvae treated with neem oil were deformed. Work in Yemen confirmed the beneficial effect of neem; neem oil and sunflower oil halted the development of caterpillars of the potato tuber moth in storage. However, caution is needed since the oil seemed to interfere with potato respiration, leaving the potatoes very soft with dark tissue (Kroschel, 1995).;A Bt (;Bacillus thuringiensis;) preparation in powder form mixed with fine sand (1:25) dusted was very effective in controlling this pest in the store in Yemen and Kenya (Kroschel, 1995). Tuber infestation was also reduced by bedding the potatoes in the leaves of the Peruvian pepper tree (;Schinus molle;), also known as mpilipili in Swahili, and Eucalyptus sp. (Kroschel, 1995).;Storing potatoes in layers with branches of lantana is recommended by Kenya Institute of Organic Farming (KIOF) in areas where this pest is present lantana is reported to repel tuber moths.;Application of plenty of wood ash or diatomite earth may also prevent rapid build up of tuber moth.",

      "pest_description": "Mealybugs ( Rastrococcus  spp.)   \n\tMealybugs are small, flat, soft bodied insects covered with a distinctive segmentation. Their body is covered with a white woolly secretion. They suck sap from tender leaves, petioles and fruits. Seriously attacked leaves turn yellow and eventually dry. This can lead to shedding of leaves,  inflorescence s, and young fruit. Mealybugs excrete honeydew on which sooty mould developed. Heavy coating with honeydew blackens the leaves, branches and fruit. This reduces  photosynthesis , can cause leaf drop and affect the market value of the fruit. \n\t  \n\tA wide range of natural enemies attacks mealybugs. The most important are ladybird beetles, hover flies, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These natural enemies usually control mealybugs. However, mealybugs can cause economic damage to mango when natural enemies are disturbed (for instance by ants feeding on honeydew produced by mealybugs or other insects) or killed by broad-spectrum pesticides, or when mealybugs are introduced to new areas, where there are no efficient natural enemies. \n\t  \n\tThe latter is the case of two serious mealybug pests on mangoes in Africa:  Rastrococcus invadens  in West and Central Africa and  Rastrococcus iceryoides  in East Africa. These mealybugs, of Asian origin, were introduced into Africa, where they developed into serious pests since the natural enemies present were not able to control them. They cause shedding of leaves,  inflorescence s and young fruits. In addition, sooty moulds growing on honeydews excreted by the insects render the fruits unmarketable and the trees unsuitable for shading. They cause direct damage to fruits leading to 40 to 80% losses depending on locality, variety and season.  Rastrococcus invadens  was brought under control in West and Central Africa by two parasitic wasps ( Gyranusoidea tebygi  and  Anagyrus mangicola ) introduced from India (Neuenschwander, 2003). \n\t  \n\t Rastrococcus iceryoides  is a major pest of mango in East Africa, mainly Tanzania and coastal Kenya. Although several natural enemies are known to attack this mealybug in its aboriginal home of southern Asia (Tandon and Lal, 1978; CABI, 2000), none have been introduced so far into Africa (ICIPE). \n\tInsecticides do not generally provide adequate control of mealybugs owing to their wax coating.",

Growth of young tea is reduced by mites by about 30%.   1) Red crevice tea mite ( Brevipalpus phoenicis ) They are also known as the false  spider mites  or the  scarlet mites . They attack leaves of all ages, distorting them. They feed on the undersides of leaves, especially between the main veins at the petiole end. Corky areas are formed on the underside of leaves, especially between the main veins at the petiole end of leaves; attacked leaves may dry up and be prematurely shed; they may cause serious defoliation, resulting in reduced yield. Numerous tiny red mites can be seen in the bark crevices of the new wood. A few bushes may be heavily attacked, leaving the majority almost free from attack. This mite is a major pest of tea, causing heavy damage especially in prolonged drought. It occurs in all growing areas in Kenya, being serious around the Mount Kenya region (Sudoi et al., 1994).   2) Tea red spider mite ( Oligonychus coffeae ) It is also called  red coffee mite . It may cause considerable losses to tea production. Mite attacks are usually confined to few bushes. These mites are reddish brown and purple. They feed together on the upper surfaces of the leaves, the cast skins of the immature stages remain stuck on to the leaf and maybe seen with the unaided eye as irregular white spots. The upper surface of fully hardened leaves turns yellowish brown, rusty or purple colour. If the tea bush is under drought stress, flush leaves may also be attacked. They usually prefer older leaves but in heavy infestations younger leaves maybe attacked. This mite has been recorded in all tea growing areas in Kenya in low to moderate infestations (Sudoi, 1991). For more information on  Spider mites click here .   3) Yellow tea mite ( Polyphagotarsonemus latus ) It is also known as  broad mite . It is a minute mite yellowish to whitish in colour and cannot be seen with the naked eye. This mite is a sporadically serious pest in tea nurseries, and has been reported as a common pest of tea in Tanzania (Bohlen, 1973). Attacked leaves remain small, are crinkled, or otherwise distorted with corky brown areas between the main veins on the underside of the leaf.

Sudoi (1998) found that although neem seed oil at a rate of 0.03% was not satisfactory on contact against the tea red spider mite, direct application on the pest at 2.5% significantly reduced its survival. Thus, he considered that neem products have potential against spider mites in tea nurseries and in the field. In India, neem oil and commercial neem products ('Neemguard', 'Repelin' and 'Biosol') significantly reduced broad mites on chilli (Ascher et al., 2002).;Till weeds early enough before the main harvest begins.;Use resistant;clones;, if available. It has been observed that certain;clones;suffer more attack by red spider mites than others during an outbreak of the mites. Thus, clone \"7/9\" is less suitable for red spider mite development. Certain;clones;, like \"SFS 150\" and \"6/8\", exhibit;resistance;to the red crevice tea mite (Sudoi, 1992).;Provide good growing conditions, healthy plants are more likely to withstand mite attack. Studies in the Eastern Highlands of Kenya showed that nitrogen fertilisation increased plant vigour and induced;tolerance;to attack by the red crevice mite (Sudoi et al., 2001).",

Spots exude moisture from a central puncture when squeezed. As a result the leaves are twisted and the shoots can be severely stunted. Die-back of young shoots is common under heavy attack.

The nymphs are whitish or greenish in colour. They feed on leaves of all ages. Attacked buds are small, crisp and are brittle (easy to break). When the damaged bud unfolds, the leaves have a brown line of dry scars (like cork) along either side of the main rib. Yellow mites cause similar corky lesions, but thrips feeding usually does not cause the leaves to curl up like yellow mite. Even a few thrips feeding on a bud can lower the quality of the bud, making the dried buds brittle and the processed tea bitter.   Attacked leaves show silvering and a fine speckling of black spots, which are the excreta of the thrips. Damaged, leaves become thicker and harder than the normal ones, duller (not shining) and having darker green colour, and may be puckered or deformed. Thrips may also feed on the surface of stems, but only near the tip of a young shoot. This stem feeding causes rough, brown dots or patches on the surface of the stem. A tea bush with many thrips is often stunted and dry. Thrips can cause economic damage mainly in periods of drought.",

      "pest_description": "Russian wheat aphid ( Diuraphis noxia )   Cereal aphids, being vectors of virus diseases, such as the Barley yellow dwarf virus, can be serious pests in wheat. The important cereal aphids that attack wheat in Kenya include  Schizaphis graminum, Sitobion avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi, R. maidis, Metopolophium dirhodum  and  Diuraphis noxia  (the Russian wheat aphid). The  Russian Wheat Aphid  ( Diuraphis noxia ) is one of the most damaging pests of small grain cereals (e.g. wheat, barley, triticale, rye, and oats) in the world. This aphid is a relatively new pest of wheat in Kenya. It was first identified in farmers' fields in 1995. It then spread quickly to all the wheat growing areas of the country and it is nowadays the most important pest of wheat and barley. It is also a major pest in South Africa, but has maintained minor pest status in Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. The Russian wheat aphid is pale to light green in colour with an elongated, spindle shaped body and grows to up to 2 mm long. It has short antennae with rounded very short, nearly invisible cornicles. The feature that easily distinguishes it from other cereal aphids is the presence of an appendage above the cauda, which gives the aphid the appearance of having 2 tails. They prefer to live in the leaf whorls or in tightly rolled leaves, and thus are partially protected from natural enemies and from contact insecticides. They are hardy and can survive extremely low temperatures. Dry weather favours rapid increase of the aphid. Unlike many important cereal aphids, the Russian wheat aphid is not a known transmitter of diseases, but causes damage by injecting a toxin into the plants during feeding. This toxin prevents the production of chlorophyll and causes, in susceptible  cultivar s, leaf  chlorosis , longitudinal leaf rolling and white/yellow (warm weather) or purple reddish (cold weather) streaking on the leaves. Extensive  chlorosis  leads to death of plants while leaf rolling retards plant development causing stunted growth. The tight rolling of flag leaves delays ear emergence, leading to floret sterile heads resulting in reduction of seed set. Aphid infestation also reduces the quality of the seeds produced, as shown by low kernel weight, increased rate of seed deterioration under accelerated ageing conditions, and reduced seedling vigour. The effect of infestation on seed quality is more pronounced under dry conditions. Infestation also may result in reduced seedling vigour. In Kenya, the damage usually appears when crops have attained the tillering stage. Yield losses ranging from 25 to 90% have been reported.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Scout your crop regularly. Check for damage signs (first noticeable sign is slight to moderate yellowing of small areas of crop within the field; in addition the crop may appear to be under drought stress, even if there is no drought.).;Use the correct seed rate to ensure good plant density, as low plant densities are susceptible to heavy attack by the aphid.;Plant as early as possible for your area.;Provide good growing conditions for the crop. A crop that is not stressed is more tolerant to aphid attack.;Remove volunteer plants and grasses because they act as the aphid's hosts even before the main crop has been planted.",

It is the most numerous bird species in the world. The red-billed quelea is mainly granivorous, except when feeding its chicks insects or when eating insects prior to migration or breeding, and it relies on a supply of grass seeds to survive. When unable to find grass seeds or when opportunities arise, quelea will attack crops such as wheat, millet, oats, sorghum, teff, rice. It is a major pest throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and can cause significant economical losses. The bird is inherently nomadic and this nomadism accounts for its invasions into areas where it was previously absent.",

While feeding they inject toxins into pods/seeds causing  necrosis . \n\t  \n\tThe most important are  stink bugs  (e.g.  Nezara viridula, and Piezodorus hybneri), Riptortus bugs (Riptortus dentipes), Mirperus jaculus , giant coreid bugs ( Anoplocnemis curvipes ), and spiny brown bugs ( Clavigralla  spp.). \n\t  \n\tExtensive stink bugs feeding may result in pod abortion and the destruction of seeds. Severe pod abortion may induce such plants to remain in the vegetative stage, causing foliar retention, which poses problems at harvest. The green  stink bug  ( Nezara viridula ) also injects a fungus ( Nematospora coryli ) into the developing seeds, which is the casual agent of the yeast spot disease. A single stink bug puncture may result in the loss of seed germination. Direct pod and seed injury may result in yield loss and decrease in seed quality due to  microorganism s, even if plants compensate for considerable injury that occurs during early pod-set. Damage at the end of the seed- development will result in yield loss. \n\tSucking bugs are difficult to control since they are very mobile and can infest the crop from neighbouring crops.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Sucking bugs are attacked by parasitic wasps and assassin bugs. In Ghana, a threshold of 2-3 bugs/metre row is suggested.;Control strategies should be related to the stage of pod development. It has been shown that early pod fill is the most sensitive stage to attack by green stink bugs (;N. viridula;), and the only one in which yield, seed weight and oil content was significantly reduced. Bugs should be controlled before this stage is reached, i.e. towards the end of pod elongation. Once pod fill is completed, soybeans are not at risk and control is not warranted unless planting seed or edible seed is being grown (CABI, 2005).;Research in Indonesia has shown that Sesbania rostrata is an effective;trap crop;, for managing stink bugs and Riptortus bugs on soybeans (Naito, 1981, 1996). Sesbania rostrata is taller than soybean, and since it takes longer to mature, it can also attract stink bugs over a longer period. In addition to attracting adults of N. viridula, it helps to reduce their numbers, since it is not a suitable food plant for nymphal development. Sesbania is usually planted on two opposite sides of a soybean field.;Spraying with aromatic plants (e.g. gums, lantana, khaki weed,etc.) has been suggested to repel bugs (Elwell and Mass, 1995).;Neem-based pesticides reportedly reduce feeding by green shield bugs.",

      "pest_description": "Sorghum shoot fly ( Atherigona soccata )   It is the most important pest of sorghum at the seedling stage. The adult is similar to the housefly, smaller in size (3-5 mm long), and greyish in colour, and abdomen yellow with brown patches. The larvae or maggots are yellowish or whitish in colour, up to 8 mm long. The fly lays eggs either at the base of young shoots near soil surfaces, or in older plants, on the leaves. The maggots crawl inside the sheath and bore into the heart of the young shoot killing the growing point and the youngest leaf, which turns brown and withers. This damage is known as \"dead heart\". When good growing conditions prevail the young plants are usually able to compensate the damage by producing new tillers, which may partly escape attack, but later the ripening of the ear heads will be unequal. In weak plant repeated infestation may cause serious losses. Sometimes the damage is so severe that many seedlings die and the field has to be replanted. Older plants (over 30 days after seedling emergence) are generally not damaged by the shoot fly. However, when shoot flies are abundant (during the rainy season under moderate temperatures and high humidity) older plants may be attacked, but they do not produce the dead-heart symptoms. Instead, the damaged leaf becomes thin and papery, and wraps around the other leaves. As a result, the plants may fail to grow normally. Late infestations may also damage the panicle in the formative stage, resulting in rotting or drying up of a portion of the panicle affected by shoot fly damage.",

Application of fertiliser has been related to lower damage by shoot-fly possibly by increasing plant vigour. However, shoot-fly damage has been found to be greater in plots treated with cattle manure. This may have been due to the attraction of shoot flies to the odours emanating from the organic manure.;Intercropping. It has been shown that shoot fly damage is reduced when sorghum is intercropped with leguminous crops.;Fallowing and a closed season reduce the carryover and build-up of the shoot fly from one season to the next.

Nearly 30% of sorghum grain was damaged by sorghum midge in 1990 in western Kenya. In southern Africa, there are reports of 25% of sorghum grain damaged by sorghum midge (CABI, 2000). The adults are small (3 mm long), deep-red midges, with transparent wings. Eggs are laid in the flowering heads. The small orange larvae feed in the developing seed. Attacked seeds become shrunken and flat resulting in empty or \"chaffy heads\" as shrivelled grains fail to develop. The larva pupates inside the spikelet, and before adult emergence, the pupa wriggles its way to the tip of the spikelet. After adult emergence, the pupal case remains attached to the chaffy spikelet.

Midge damage is reported to be higher in crops with low plant density (CABI, 2000).;Selective removal of alternative hosts. Wild species of sorghum (for example,;S. halepense;and;S. sudanense;) act as alternative hosts for sorghum midge. Midge populations build up early in the season on wild species of sorghum and infest the sorghum crop later in the season. Removing these alternative hosts from the vicinity of the sorghum crop can reduce the rate of multiplication of sorghum midge populations. However, wild hosts also sustain the natural enemies, and thus may help in increasing the role of natural enemies in population suppression.;Field sanitation.

Although tomato plant is the main host for  T. absoluta , the pest also attacks other plants in the Solanacea family including potato, nightshade, eggplant, pepino, tobacco and solanaceous weeds such as Datura. The life cycle of  T. absoluta  is completed within 30-35 days.  T. absoluta  can have 10-12 generations per year. Females can lay up  250-300 eggs on host plants. Eggs are small, cylindrical, creamy-white to yellow and approximately 0.35 mm long. Eggs hatch in 4-6 days after egg laying. The larva is cream-colored with a characteristic dark head.  T. absoluta  has four larval  instar s. Pupation may take place in the soil, on the leaf surface or within mines. The adults are small moths with 5-7 mm body length. The adults have thread-like antennae and forewings with grey scales and black spots. The larvae feed between the leaf layers causing irregular mines. They eventually tunnel into the stems or burrow into the fruits, leaving black frass as it tunnels. T. absoluta  is a very challenging pest to control because of its fast reproductive rate (10 -12 generations per year), short life cycle, nocturnal adults, and concealed larval stage inside the plant parts.

      "pest_description": "Pineapple mealybug ( Dysmicoccus brevipes )    The mealybugs are oval, pink in colour, up to 3 mm long, covered with a whitish waxy secretion, which develops into waxy filaments around the body. This mealybug is the most serious pest of pineapples, because it is a vector of the Mealybug or Pineapple Wilt Virus. The mealybug is common on the roots of pineapple and large colonies develop on the stems just above ground level.   The mealybugs may spread upwards to feed in the floral cavities, on both small and mature fruit, and on the crown leaves. Heavy infestations are conspicuous because of the white waxy adults, which often occur at the growing points, around the stem nodes, on the undersides of leaves, on the fruit and on the roots.   Feeding on leaves causes yellowing and drying up of the leaf-tips, which progresses towards the base of the leaves. Feeding in the blossom cavities causes wounds, which sometimes become contaminated by fungal spores resulting in a disorder called black spot. Feeding on roots is associated with the rotting of roots and subsequent wilting of the plant. \"Smooth Cayenne\" crowns used as planting material are frequently infested with mealybugs, and therefore new plantations usually become infested from the time of planting.   The bigheaded ant,  Pheidole megacephala , is commonly associated with mealybug colonies. They do not attack the mealybugs but feed on the honeydew excreted by the mealybugs, preventing the formation of thick honeydew coats where crawlers (young mealybugs) may get entangled. Moreover, while feeding on honeydew, the ants interfere with the mealybug natural enemies. Thus, mealybug colonies thrive in presence of ants. Mealybug infestations may also be spread into new plantings by ants carrying the young mealybugs from one plant to another in their jaws.",

      "pest_description": "Stemborers   Stemborers are the most important pests of sugarcane. Several species of stemborers attack sugarcane. The most important is the African stemborer.   1)  African sugarcane stalkborer  ( Eldana saccharina ) Adult moth has a wingspan of 30 to 40 mm. It has elongated, pale brown forewings, each with two small spots in the centre, and whitish hind wings with a short fringe. Adult moths congregate on the cane canopy at night, they are attracted to light and so populations can be sampled using light traps. Female moths lay batches of yellow, oval eggs behind the leaf sheath or in folds of dead leaves. Eggs become pink before hatching. Young caterpillars feed on the leaves eating away the upper layers of the tissue; this damage is known as windowing. Later, they penetrate into the stalks. Caterpillars usually burrow into single  internodes . When burrowing in the stem, caterpillars push their excrement outside.   Large amounts of frass are often hanging from the exit hole made by caterpillars prior to pupation. Caterpillars are light brown to dark grey coloured with brown with very small dark coloured spots. Pupation takes place in the plants, in the stem or on the leaf sheath. At emergence, the moth leaves a large emergence hole in the stalk. Attacked plants are stunted; in severe attacks they may dry up and die. When very young plants are attacked \"dead heart\" results, followed by tillering of the plant.   Older plants or ratoon cane have  internodes  bored. Crop losses are hard to assess because they vary with the age of the cane. In unstressed, maturing cane, quite high numbers of borers may be present without serious crop loss, but where infested, stressed cane is left to stand from one season to the next, the loss may be total. This stemborer also attacks maize and sorghum.   2)  Spotted cane borer   ( Chilo sacchariphagus ) It is a serious pest of sugarcane in the Indian Ocean Islands (Mauritius and Reunion), and also attacking sugarcane in Mozambique and South Africa.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Adjustments to crop management are the most effective measures in the control of African sugarcane borer.;Use borer-free planting material (setts).;Check planting material for signs of stem boring, which may indicate the presence of caterpillar and/or pupae.;Avoid plant stress, such as drought, since stressed crops are more prone to stemborer attack.;Cut older canes out, as soon as possible after 12 months, because the numbers of borers accumulate as cane ages, especially after about nine months.;Do not leave tops of plants in fields; in East Africa caterpillars of the African cane borer are largely found on the upper part of the plant, and crop residue will maintain carryover population for the next growing season.;Proper fertilisation is important; in particular nitrogenous fertilisers have shown to influence stemborer attack. In South Africa, where the African sugarcane borer is a problem, a reduction in nitrogen fertilisation rate from 50 kg to 30 kg per hectare is recommended. However, the yield outcome should be considered when deciding in reducing nitrogen input, though nitrogen fertilisation enhances borer development it also enhances the plant's;tolerance;to borer attack, and the outcome in terms of yield may be positive.;Trashing has been recommended for control of stemborers. De-trashing sugarcane crops during the 5th, 7th and 9th month of growth has been recommended in India for control of the spotted cane borer. Pre-trashing of mature cane reportedly reduces numbers of the African sugarcane borer by 30% or more (Carnegie, 1991).;Burning attacked fields at harvest or burning of residual cane is sometimes suggested, as it is more likely to destroy the pests than trashing, However, there are concerns that it may do more harm than good by destroying natural enemies.;Parasitic wasps and;predator;s attack caterpillars of the African sugarcane borer. In particular;Cotesia sesamiae;is widespread. The introduced spotted cane borer is attacked by the parasitic wasp;Cotesia flavipes;introduced in the region for control of the spotted stemborer;Chilo partellus;. In Madagascar, parasitism of 60% of caterpillars of the spotted cane borer by this parasitic wasp has been reported (Kfir et al, 2002).",

Broad mites are tiny (0.1-0.2 mm long) and cannot be seen with the naked eye, and are even difficult to detect with a hand lens. An attack by the broad mites can be detected by the symptoms of damage.   Their feeding produces discolouration,  necrosis  of tissues and deformation. Initial attack occurs on stems of terminal shoots and young terminal leaves. Attacked young leaves are stunted, deformed (slender, twisted or crumpled), fail to elongate and finally may wilt and dry.

Upon hatching, the small maggots wiggle down to the leaf blade and move between the leaf sheath and the stem until the growing points where they feed for 2 to 3 weeks. Larval feeding induces development of light swellings or galls, which are inconspicuous until larvae are ready to pupate. The galls are long cylindrical, about 3 mm in  diameter  and from a few cm up to 1 to 1.5 m long. They are often silvery white and resemble an onion leaf, hence they are generally known as 'silver shoots' or 'onion leaf galls'. Galls generally appear about 20 to 40 days after the crop has been transplanted. Gall midges can cause serious damage from the seedling stage to panicle initiation. Attacked tillers do not produce panicles. Galled plants may tiller profusely to compensate for loss of growing points. A serious attack results in stunted plant growth and poor yields. Gall midges do not attack rice plants that have matured beyond tillering stage. These midges spent some generations on wild grasses and then move to attack young rice plants.

Adult beetles have numerous spines on thorax and abdomen.  Trichispa sericea  is the most common of the hispid beetles. The adult is a dark grey beetle covered with spines, and about 3 to 4 mm long. Females lay eggs singly in slits made under the epidermis of the upper portion of the leaf. Eggs are white, boat-shaped and about 1 mm long. Upon hatching, the grubs (larvae) mine within the leaf. Grubs are slender, yellow and about six mm long. They pupate in the mine. When infested leaves are held against the light, the grub or pupa may be seen as a dark spot in the mine. Hispid beetles attack the crop in the early growth stages. Larval feeding occurs during the tillering stage. The first attack in a field is highly localised, but the infested area spreads rapidly. Feeding by adults on the leaves causes characteristic narrow white streaks or feeding scars that run along the long axis of the leaf. Mining by grubs within the leaf shows as irregular pale brown blister-like patches. Feeding results in loss of chlorophyll and the plants wither and die. The most serious damage occurs in nurseries, which may be completely destroyed. Severe infestations sporadically occur on transplanted rice and can kill the plant.

Another species  Hydrellia  sp. has been reported in Kenya (NIB, 1995). Adults of the rice whorl maggot and rice leafminers are small flies (1.5 to 3 mm long), grey to black in colour with silvery white or golden brown markings on the lower part of the head. They lay white cigar-shaped eggs on the leaves. Upon hatching the maggots of the leafminers penetrate the leaf tissue and feed in between the 2 layers of the leaf causing mines parallel to the veins. Maggots may pupate in an existing mine or migrate to a different leaf to form a new mine. High humidity (80-100% relative humidity) is required for leafminer development, therefore, mines are typically observed in leaves close or lying on the water surface. Whorl maggots start feeding on the leaf margins causing large scarred areas giving the leaf a ragged appearance and causing eventual leaf collapse. Eventually the maggots enter the whorl and tunnel the plant's developing stem. \n\t  \n\tFeeding damage by leafminers retards plant development, reduces plant vigour and renders infested plants less competitive with weeds. Plant vigour and weather conditions affect the extent and seriousness of the damage caused by the rice leafminer. Damage extent is closely related to the speed the plant growths erect and out of the water. Any factor affecting plant growth, which increases the number of leaves remaining lying on the water, or the length of time they are fully in contact with water will increase damage. The plant is usually able to produce additional leaves, but continued mining can result in reduced tillering, greater susceptibility to later pest attack, delayed maturity, or death of the plant. Once leaves start growing upright above the water, the rice leafminer does not cause economic damage. Attack by the whorl maggot may kill young plants (2 to 6 weeks after emergence) depending on the severity of the damage. Plants that survived damage are eventually drowned by the flood, or plant stands get so thinned that are easily overwhelmed by weeds. \n\tOther leaf-mining fly ( Creodont orbiting ) has been reported as a minor pest in West Africa. This leaf-mining fly is widely spread in the rice-growing region in Ghana, but it is of no apparent economic importance. The adult is a small fly (about 1.6 mm long). Females lay eggs into the leaf tissue, and the maggots feed forming mines towards the leaf tip. Maggots pupate within the mines. Symptoms of damage are the transparent, light brown mines that are elongated along one side of the midrib reaching up to 6 cm in length.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "The rice leafminer can be controlled by managing the water level.;Avoid leaf contact with water. However, this practice seems to intensify the whorl maggot problem. Field observations in Louisiana, USA showed that by draining fields, the maggot enters the plant whorl and stems without being drowned (LSU AgCenter).;Drain the water at intervals of 3 to 4 days during the first 30 days after;transplanting;to reduce egg laying as the adult flies are more attracted to standing water.;To reduce the potential for damage by the rice leafminer encourage the rice to emerge quickly and grow erect.;Level the field as accurately as possible and start the crop in 7-10 cm of water. Increase the water depth slowly after the leaves begin to grow upright.;Monitor for rice leafminers to determine the need to lower the water level. Begin monitoring two to four weeks after planting, just after most of the rice plants have emerged from beneath the water and the leaves are lying on the water surface (UC Pest Management Guidelines).;Crop establishment methods that enable the plants to cover the water surface most rapidly usually result in insignificant damage.Thus, close planting has been shown to decrease egg laying and subsequent damage by leafminers in several countries in Asia and South America.",

They are very small and are usually not noticed until large numbers are present. Many different kinds of mites are encountered during mushroom cultivation process. Some mites feed on  fungi  and bacteria that exist in great amounts in decaying organic materials used as a substrate in mushroom production. Other members of mites are  predator s that mainly feed on nematodes and smaller mites. Only a few of them are considered as mushroom pests. These include mushroom mites or tarsonemid mites ( Tarsonemus myceliophagus ) and red pepper mites ( Pygmephorus sellnicki ). The mushroom mites are so small, that they are not seen with a naked eye. They are shiny, light brown in colour feeding on the mushroom mycelium and mycelium of many other competing  fungi  present in the substrate. They gnaw the bases of mushroom stipes (stalks of mushroom) which in result become rounded and obtain a reddish-brown shade. The amount of damage they bring to the growing crop will depend on the time and degree of infestation. If a large population of mites enters the batch at spawning, the damage can be significant. Red pepper mites got their names from their reddish-brown colour and are often found moving on the mushroom caps or the casing surface. These mites are not regarded as primary pests, their presence is usually an indicator that  Trichoderma  (green mould) is present in the compost. These mites feed on various weed moulds but not mushrooms, thus their presence indicates that the compost is unsatisfactory. They are yellowish-brown in colour, 0.25 mm in length and have a flattened appearance. They spread spores of  Trichoderma  from bag to bag. They feed on competing  fungi  and that is why their presence indicates poorly prepared compost and possible presence of  Trichoderma . They reproduce very fast one female can lay up to 160 eggs within 5 days. They cause browning of mushroom heads and promote the spreading of green molds not only in the infected room, but also in the whole farm. When their population is high, they cause discomfort and even allergy to mushroom pickers at work.",

They lay eggs in the substrate, casing layer and mushrooms. Each female can lay up to 170 eggs. At a temperature of 24.5degC development from egg to adult takes about 21 days. Emerging larvae (maggots) feed on the substrate, mushroom mycelium and developing mushrooms. Damaged mycelium results in the formation of pins brown in colour and having a leathery surface. Developing pins and young mushrooms may not survive after larval attack. Infested young mushrooms become hollow and shrink, and may eventually die. Larvae may also tunnel ripe mushrooms forming many passage ways and holes, which makes the mushrooms unsuitable for human consumption.

The affected area becomes raised and blister-like. Later the affected tissue dries up, dies and becomes discoloured, forming a large and continuous callous area, light brown and scaly and/or scabby. Damage by feeding on young papaya fruits is manifested by sunken areas. Sometimes feeding by the mite causes a copious outflow of a milky white liquid that mars the appearance of the fruits.

The most important are ladybird beetles, hover flies, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These natural enemies usually control mealybugs. However, mealybugs can cause economic damage to mango when natural enemies are disturbed (for instance by ants feeding on honeydew produced by mealybugs or other insects) or killed by broad-spectrum pesticides, or when mealybugs are introduced to new areas, where there are no efficient natural enemies. \n\t  \n\tThe latter is the case of two serious mealybug pests on mangoes in Africa:  Rastrococcus invadens  in West and Central Africa and  Rastrococcus iceryoides  in East Africa. These mealybugs, of Asian origin, were introduced into Africa, where they developed into serious pests since the natural enemies present were not able to control them.

      "pest_description": "Whiteflies   Several species of whiteflies are found on cassava in Africa. Feeding causes direct damage, which may cause considerable reduction in root yield if prolonged feeding occurs. Some whiteflies cause major damage to cassava as vectors of cassava viruses. The spiralling whitefly ( Aleurodicus dispersus ) was reported as a new pest of cassava in West Africa in the early 90s. The adults and nymphs of this whitefly occur in large numbers on the lower surfaces of leaves covered with large amount of white waxy material. Females lay eggs on the lower leaf surface in spiral patterns (like fingerprints) of white material secreted by the female. This whitefly sucks sap from cassava leaves. It excretes large amounts of honeydew, which supports the growth of black sooty mould on the plant, causing premature fall of older leaves.   The  tobacco whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) transmits the  African cassava mosaic virus , one of the most important factors limiting production in Africa. The adults and nymphs of the tobacco whitefly occur on the lower surface of young leaves. They are not covered with white material. The nymphs appear as pale yellow oval specks to the naked eye.",

Eggs hatch into maggots that bore into the leaf tissue to feed. Their feeding induces formation of small galls, which look like pimples on the leaves. Mature maggot leaves the galls and drop to the soil to pupate, leaving small holes on the leaves. These holes may serve as entrance for fungal infections. Leaves may be covered with galls and the surrounding tissue may die. Heavy infestation may lead to premature leaf drop.",

Their body is covered with a white woolly secretion. They suck sap from tender leaves, petioles and fruits. Seriously attacked leaves turn yellow and eventually dry. This can lead to shedding of leaves,  inflorescence s, and young fruit. Mealybugs excrete honeydew on which sooty mould developed. Heavy coating with honeydew blackens the leaves, branches and fruit. This reduces  photosynthesis , can cause leaf drop and affect the market value of the fruit. \n\t  \n\tA wide range of natural enemies attacks mealybugs. The most important are ladybird beetles, hover flies, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These natural enemies usually control mealybugs. However, mealybugs can cause economic damage to mango when natural enemies are disturbed (for instance by ants feeding on honeydew produced by mealybugs or other insects) or killed by broad-spectrum pesticides, or when mealybugs are introduced to new areas, where there are no efficient natural enemies. \n\t  \n\tThe latter is the case of two serious mealybug pests on mangoes in Africa:  Rastrococcus invadens  in West and Central Africa and  Rastrococcus iceryoides  in East Africa. These mealybugs, of Asian origin, were introduced into Africa, where they developed into serious pests since the natural enemies present were not able to control them. They cause shedding of leaves,  inflorescence s and young fruits. In addition, sooty moulds growing on honeydews excreted by the insects render the fruits unmarketable and the trees unsuitable for shading. They cause direct damage to fruits leading to 40 to 80% losses depending on locality, variety and season.  Rastrococcus invadens  was brought under control in West and Central Africa by two parasitic wasps ( Gyranusoidea tebygi  and  Anagyrus mangicola ) introduced from India (Neuenschwander, 2003). \n\t  \n\t Rastrococcus iceryoides  is a major pest of mango in East Africa, mainly Tanzania and coastal Kenya. Although several natural enemies are known to attack this mealybug in its aboriginal home of southern Asia (Tandon and Lal, 1978; CABI, 2000), none have been introduced so far into Africa (ICIPE). \n\tInsecticides do not generally provide adequate control of mealybugs owing to their wax coating.",

      "pest_description": "Scales   Scales are small (1 to 7 mm long), generally immobile insects, varying in colour and shape according to the species. Female scales have neither wings nor legs. They resemble small shells glued to the plant. Females lay eggs under their scale. Once hatched, the tiny scales (known as crawlers) emerged from under the protective scale. They move in search of a feeding site and do not move afterwards. They suck sap on all above the ground plant parts.   There are two main groups of scales on mangoes:  soft  and  armoured  scales. Soft scales excrete honeydew. The most common soft scales on mangoes are soft green scales ( Coccus viridis ), brown soft scales ( Coccus hesperidum ), and wax scales ( Ceroplastes  spp.). The most important armoured scale on mango is the mango white scale ( Aulacaspis tubercularis ). The body of this scale is reddish brown. Females are covered with a white round shell, while males have a small rectangular shell with two groves. Feeding by scales may cause yellowing of leaves followed by leaf drop, poor growth, dieback of branches, fruit drop, and blemishes on fruits. Heavily infested young trees may die. In addition, soft scales excrete honeydew, causing growth of sooty mould. In heavy infestations fruits and leaves are heavily coated with sooty mould, turning black. This reduces photosynthetic capacity. Fruits contaminated with sooty mould loose market value. Ants are usually associated with soft scales. They feed on the honeydew excreted by soft scales, preventing a build-up in sooty moulds, but also protecting the scales from natural enemies. Armoured scales do not excrete honeydew.",

These natural enemies usually control scales. Outbreaks are generally caused by the use of broad-spectrum pesticides that kill natural enemies, and/or to the presence of large number of ants that feed on honeydew produced by soft scales or other insects (mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids, black flies).;Spray if necessary with light mineral oils. However, care should be taken when using mineral oils, since at high concentrations, they may be harmful to the trees. Oil sprays should be carried out after picking and not during flowering or during periods of excessive heat or drought.

Stemborer caterpillars bore into stems of millets disrupting the flow of nutrient from the roots to the upper parts of plants. Attack on young millet plants causes damage known as \"dead hearts\". In older plants the top part of the stem dies as a result of tunnelling by the borers.   The millet stemborer  ( Coniesta ignefusalis ) It is the dominant stemborer of millet in the Sahelian zone of Africa, and also attacks sorghum, maize, and wild grasses. Major damage has been reported in West Africa. It has also been found causing considerable damage to millet in Western Eritrea, being considered as the major pest of millets in Eritrea (B. Le Ru, icipe, personal communication). The moths have golden brown forewings. They are active throughout the night and during the day rest on the lower surface of leaves or along stems. Caterpillars are cream-coloured with black spots along the body. However in the dry season, when caterpillars enter in diapause (a resting period) they change colour to pale yellow or uniform cream white. They stay in this resting period from 6 to 7 months, but occasionally for more than a year.   Moths lay eggs between the leaf sheet and the stem in batches of 20 to 50 eggs. Caterpillars tunnel in the leaf sheets and in the underlying stem. They normally pupate within the stem. Small plants on which eggs are laid may be thoroughly riddle with caterpillars and soon collapse, but in larger plants external symptoms show two to three weeks after stems have been infested. Economic damage results from early plant death ( \"dead-heart\") stem tunnelling, disruption of nutrient flow, steam breakage, poor or no grain formation and empty heads. Crop losses have been estimated at $91 million a year. For more information on the  African maize stalk borer click here . For more information on the  Spotted stalkborer click here .",

They suck sap from tender leaves, petioles and fruits. Seriously attacked leaves turn yellow and eventually dry. This can lead to shedding of leaves,  inflorescence s, and young fruit. Mealybugs excrete honeydew on which sooty mould developed. Heavy coating with honeydew blackens the leaves, branches and fruit. This reduces  photosynthesis , can cause leaf drop and affect the market value of the fruit. \n\t  \n\tA wide range of natural enemies attacks mealybugs. The most important are ladybird beetles, hover flies, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These natural enemies usually control mealybugs. However, mealybugs can cause economic damage to mango when natural enemies are disturbed (for instance by ants feeding on honeydew produced by mealybugs or other insects) or killed by broad-spectrum pesticides, or when mealybugs are introduced to new areas, where there are no efficient natural enemies. \n\t  \n\tThe latter is the case of two serious mealybug pests on mangoes in Africa:  Rastrococcus invadens  in West and Central Africa and  Rastrococcus iceryoides  in East Africa. These mealybugs, of Asian origin, were introduced into Africa, where they developed into serious pests since the natural enemies present were not able to control them. They cause shedding of leaves,  inflorescence s and young fruits. In addition, sooty moulds growing on honeydews excreted by the insects render the fruits unmarketable and the trees unsuitable for shading. They cause direct damage to fruits leading to 40 to 80% losses depending on locality, variety and season.  Rastrococcus invadens  was brought under control in West and Central Africa by two parasitic wasps ( Gyranusoidea tebygi  and  Anagyrus mangicola ) introduced from India (Neuenschwander, 2003). \n\t  \n\t Rastrococcus iceryoides  is a major pest of mango in East Africa, mainly Tanzania and coastal Kenya.

Whitefly density on pumpkins and cucumbers plants growing over reflective mulch was reduced 10- to 14-fold as compared to plants growing on bare soil. This was reflected in significantly higher yields in plants grown over reflective mulch than in those grown over unmulched soil.

The colour of the adult beetles varies from black, brown, black and yellow striped or metallic blue-green depending on the species. Adult flea beetles chew small round holes (shot holes) in leaves, giving them a sieve like appearance. On rare occasions, they may feed directly on ripe fruit, just below the calyx. This damage is usually seen only in plants that show extreme foliar stress resulting from lack of water or powdery mildew. The larvae of flea beetles live in the soil and feed on roots, but the damage caused is not of economic importance. Adult flea beetles can be particularly damaging to young plants. Seedlings are most vulnerable to flea beetle feeding when stressed, particularly by inadequate moisture. Older plants can withstand considerable leaf perforation.",

Even a small flea beetle population can cause significant damage to a crop in the;cotyledon;or first-leaf stages.;Provide good nutrition and favourable growing conditions. This helps to avoid plant stress from diseases and moisture, and helps plants survive flea-beetle attack.;Weed in and around fields. This may help to eliminate flea beetle shelter and breeding grounds, reducing crop damage.;Keep plant diversity in the farm. Living mulches or polycultures are known to reduce flea-beetle damage. Diversity in the farm supports populations of natural enemies.;When necessary spray botanicals or other alternative products. Extracts of neem, rotenone, pyrethrin, sabadilla, garlic, onion and mint alone or in combination have been recommended for control of flea beetles. Insecticidal soap is reported to give partial control of flea beetles. However, sprays combining rotenone with insecticidal soap are considered very effective. Diatomaceous earth and rock powders have been observed to reduce flea-beetle populations but applications must be renewed regularly after rainfalls.",

Caterpillars of the legume pod borer ( Maruca vitrata ) are dull to yellow-white and often reach a length of 18 mm. Each segment has dark spots that form a distinct series along the length of the body. The head is dark brown to black. Caterpillars web together leaves, buds and pods and feed inside the web. Flowers attacked may be discoloured and have damaged or missing reproductive parts. Damage by this caterpillar also results in flower bud shedding and reduced pod production. Damaged pods have small, darkened entry holes on the surface. Young caterpillars of the lima bean pod borer are green, later turning red. They feed inside the pod reaching a length of 14 mm.

Both adults and nymphs feed on young leaves, young vegetative and flowering shoots, and developing fruits.   Attacked leaves are deformed and show angular lesions, particularly along the veins, which may drop off, so that the leaves appear as if attacked by biting insects. Feeding on the stalks of the tender shoots causes elongated green lesions, sometimes accompanied by exudation of gum. Severely damaged shoots die back due to the effect of bug saliva in combination with  fungi , which enter the plant tissue through the feeding lesions; the subsequent development of numerous auxiliary buds causes a bunched terminal growth known as 'witches broom'. In case of serious infestations the trees may appear as if scorched by fire. Bug feeding on developing apples and nuts causes brown sunken spots. The growth of trees is seriously retarded and fruit formation of attacking flowering shoots is reduced.",

      "pest_description": "Adult coconut bug ( Pseudotheraptus wayi )   The coconut bug ( Pseudotheraptus wayi ) is the most important pest of coconuts in East Africa. A related species of coconut bug,  Pseudotheraptus devastans , causes similar damage to coconuts in West Africa.   Adult bugs are brown in colour and 1.2 to 1.4 cm long. They lay eggs singly on the flowers or young nuts. Nymphs are red brown to green brown in colour and have long antenna. Adults and nymphs suck on flowers and developing fruits causing flower abortion and early nutfall. The toxic saliva of the bugs causes necrotic sunken lesions (scars) and cracks on the nuts. Attacked young nuts excrete gum. Many of the attacked young nuts fall off. Nuts older than 3 months at the time of attack may not be aborted but remain small and have scars. Yield losses are difficult to assess since many of the nuts (over 70%) fall naturally. Nuts which abort naturally, do not show scars or gummosis. Two bugs per palm can cause considerable damage. Damage is usually less serious in intercropped coconuts. The bugs also feed on cashew, mango, cocoa and guava.   The  predator y red weaver ant is an efficient natural enemy of the coconut bug. Weaver ants build nests on palms and other trees by joining leaves with silk produced by their larvae. They forage on the canopy chasing away or killing coconut bugs. Palms with weaver ants are usually free of damage by the coconut bug. Good control is achieved when more than 60% palms are occupied by thriving colonies of weaver ants. Unfortunately other ants present in coconut plantations fight weaver ants, and themselves do not protect (or not as effective as weaver ants) the palms against coconut bugs. These ants such as big headed ant ( Pheidole megacephala ), the crazy ant ( Anoplolepis custodiens ), and the long legged ant ( Anoplolepis longipes ) among others, kill or displace weaver ants, as a result palms are severely damaged. These competing or antagonistic ants need to be managed to allow weaver ants to do their beneficial work.",

If there were no ground vegetation this ant would be forced to search food on the trees and would displace weaver ants.;Connect the canopy of neighbouring palms/trees with sticks, wire, or ropes. Weaver ants can easily walk among trees searching for food and set up new nests avoiding other ants active on the ground.;Where weaver ants are not present transfer weaver ant nests into the field by collecting nests from bushes around and placing them onto coconut palms or other host plants in the field. Care should be taken not to mix ants from different colonies since they would fight. Do not place nests collected from different trees or trees far apart on the same trees since they are likely to belong to different colonies and will kill each other. The best time for collection of nests is during the rainy season, since in this period many new queens are present in the ant nests, and these may get established in the orchard and start new colonies. Ants in nests introduced without the queen will die out after some time (they may live up to 8 months) and new introductions are needed.",

This scale is bright yellow and round (females) or reddish and oval (males) covered with a semitransparent greyish white flat scale. The scale  diameter  is 1.5 to 2.0 mm. Females are always wingless and remain under their scale their entire life. Adult males have one pair of membranous wings, move about actively in search of females and do not feed during the adult stage. Eggs are protected underneath the scale or shell of the mother insect until they hatch. Upon hatching the young scales leave the maternal scale, take up a position and start feeding. They do not move afterwards. They are found mainly on the undersides of the leaves, but frond stalks, flower clusters and young nuts can also be attacked. A severe infestation of this armoured scale forms a continuous crust over flower spikes, young nuts and the lower surface of leaves. The leaves become yellow and eventually die. The crown dies leading to collapse of the infested plant. Attacks of young nuts cause shrivelling of nuts leading to premature nut falls. Mostly young coconut trees of up to 10-15 years are vulnerable to damage. Scales may infest palms throughout the year, but damage is usually more severe during the dry season. Neglected plantations are particularly susceptible. The coconut scale also attacks many species of fruit trees, such as avocado, breadfruit, mango, guava and papaya.

      "pest_description": "Termites   \n\tTermites are serious groundnut pests throughout the southern African region and West Africa. Species of  Microtermes  and  Odontotermes  are the most damaging, while  Macrotermes  cause occasional damage. The small-sized  Microtermes  spp., in particular, attack and invade growing groundnut plants through the roots and stem near ground level, hollowing them out and causing the plants to wilt and die with a consequent reduction in crop stand. \n\tRoots damaged by other soil pests, such as white grubs, are also prone to attack by termites. Some termite species ( Macrotermes  spp.,  Hodotermes mossambicus ) cut off stem bases, and may cause 25-100% of plant losses. As the crop ripens the outer layers of the pods are scarified (removal of soft corky tissue between the veins of the pod) by termites allowing  contamination  of the seed with soil  fungi , such as  Aspergillus flavus , which produce lethal \"aflatoxins\". \n\t Scarification  of pods is by far the most common type of termite damage at plant maturity, a factor often aggravated by late harvest.  Scarification  as high as 30% has been reported. Infested plants are not obviously diseased and are frequently harvested and contaminate the rest of the crop. Species such as  Microtermes  spp. also penetrate the pod to feed off the soft inner lining, filling the pod with soil. This form of attack leads to additional loss through premature germination of kernels. Stacks of plants left drying in the fields are also frequently attacked by species such as  Odontotermes  spp. with farmers losing between 30-40% of their crop at this stage. \n\tTermite damage is generally most serious towards the end of the growing season just prior to harvesting, and it is particularly serious during periods of drought (ARC/LRN. 2007).",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Remove residues of previous cereal crops (sorghum, millet and maize). Plant residues left in the field serve as food for termites, which may infest the new crop. Termite infestation of 100% has been observed in groundnut crops with high plant residues.;Planting should be carried out early enough to avoid drought periods. Moisture deficiency may stress a crop and lead to attack by termites due to low vigour.;Harvest promptly. Research has shown that termite damage increases with delay in harvest. Furthermore, most groundnut-producing areas in sub-Saharan Africa experience drought and high temperatures during the later part of the growing season, conditions that favour termite infestation as well as fungus (;A. flavus;) infection of pods leading to aflatoxin formation in seeds.;The complete destruction of mounds and removal of queen termites are effective control measures against mound-building species (;Macrotermes;spp.). Partial destruction of mounds is unlikely to solve the problem, since replacement reproduction may develop from the remaining termites.;It has been reported that close spacing in groundnut helps to deter termite infestation, although the reason for this was not given. However, high density sowing, followed by thinning of surviving plants where necessary to reduce competition, offsets anticipated losses due to termites.",

      "pest_description": "Groundnut leafminer ( Aproaerema modicella )   It is a common pest of groundnuts in South and South-East Asia and a major pest in India, and it has recently invaded Africa. It was first found in Uganda in 1998 and is now recorded in Mozambique, Malawi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa. In all African countries where this leafminer has been found, the pest has reached epidemic densities and severe yield losses have been observed on groundnut (The New Vision. 2004; Kenis and Cugala, 2006). The adult is a mottled moth, with a full wing span of up to 18mm. The moth lays eggs on the underside of the groundnut leaf and petioles. Yellowish green caterpillars hatch, tunnel into the leaves and feed between the upper and lower epidermis of the leaf. Mined leaves become distorted within a few days. Caterpillars are grey-green with a shiny black head. There are five larval  instar s. The first  instar  has an average length of 0.56 mm. At pupation, they rarely exceed 8 mm in length. Three or four mines per groundnut leaflet can cause so much  distortion  that a leaf exposes as little as 30% of the potential photosynthetic area to the sun. Later, when the caterpillar becomes too large to occupy the mine, they emerge to the leaf surface and either fold over a single leaf and hold it down with silk, or web together two or more leaflets. They live and feed in the shelter they have constructed. Pupation takes place inside the webbed leaflets. Damaged leaves become brownish, rolled and dry, which results in early defoliation and affects the growth and yield of the plants.",

They suck the seeds of unopened bolls causing staining of the cotton lint in a similar way as stainer bugs; as a result the development ceases and the boll aborts. \n\tBlue bugs seldom breed on cotton. They usually invade cotton when the bolls are well formed, from other host plants, for instance sorghum, sunflower, castor and many wild hosts such as crotalaria and hibiscus. \n\t Cotton lygus  ( Taylorilygus vosseleri ) \n\tThe adult bugs are up to 5 mm long and pale green to light brown in colour. The nymphs are green. Adults and nymphs prefer to suck young leaf buds, flower buds and bolls. The toxic saliva causes the flower buds to turn yellow and drop off. Leaves, which have been attacked in the bud stage, later show a ragged appearance with many irregular holes. The cotton lygus is an early season pest. \n\t  \n\t Cotton seed bug  ( Oxycarenus hyalinipennis ) \n\tThese bugs are small (4 to 6 mm) and blackish in colour. Their wings are transparent. They attack open or damaged pods mainly at the end of the growing season. It is a late season pest, which mainly appears when the bolls have opened. Nymphs and adults suck the seeds. Feeding by large numbers of bugs reduces considerably the germination rate, seed weight and oil quality. The lint is not affected.",

They feed in the bolls, damaging lint and seed and causing considerable reduction in yield and quality. The main bollworms are the African bollworm ( Helicoverpa armigera ), spiny bollworm ( Earias  spp) and the pink bollworm ( Pectinophora gossypiella ). Caterpillars of the false codling moth ( Cryptophlebia leucotreta ) are sometimes found boring in the bolls.   1) African bollworms  ( Helicoverpa armigera ) It bores into the boll often with the hind part of the body exposed outside the boll. If younger bolls are attacked they normally show a yellowish colour and the bracteoles open out (flared square). One caterpillar can damage a number of bolls and buds by moving from one to the other. Infested bolls and buds drop prematurely. 2)   Spiny bollworms  ( Earias biplaga  /  Earias insulana ) The adults are moths, about 12 mm long with a wingspan of about 20-22 mm. The forewings are white, peach, metallic green to straw yellow in colour according to the species. Fully-grown caterpillars are up to 18 mm long. Their body bears numerous fleshy spines. Caterpillars vary in colour from brown and deep orange to grey and yellow. Caterpillars bore into flower buds, young shoots and maturing bolls. Hollowed tender shoots whither and die. 3)   Pink bollworm  ( Pectinophora gossypiella ) The moths are small (about 8-9 mm long) with grey brown or brown forewings covered with dark spots. The hind wings are whitish, broader than the fore wings, and have a long fringe on the  posterior  margin. The pink caterpillars are up to 15 mm long and have 2 broken transverse red bands on each segment of the body. This is usually a late season pest. The caterpillars bore into the flower buds and young bolls causing shedding. Caterpillars feeding on flowers spin the petals together, causing the formation of what is called \"rosette flowers\" which do not open up. The bolls open prematurely and may also rot or drop to the ground. The most important damage is caused by caterpillars penetrating bolls, where they feed on the seeds and soil the lint with frass and excrements. The pest is carried over to the next season and crop as a diapause-caterpillar mainly within the cottonseeds.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Practise field hygiene. Remove and destroy old crops and plant debris after harvesting or let cattle graze in the field after the picking is over.;Crop rotation with plants not related to cotton (avoid kenaf, okra, abutilon and other malvaceas) may help to reduce attack by the pink bollworm and the spiny bollworm, but it is unlikely to be effective against the African bollworm, since this pest feed on many different plants.;Mixed cropping helps to reduce attack by bollworms; plant composition and combinations are important to optimise the benefits. Some plants may act as;trap crops;and/or may attract natural enemies that will then predate on bollworms.;In Tanzania, early sowing of \"Ukiriguru\" varieties is strongly recommended. These varieties have the ability to compensate for early crop loss of fruiting points caused by either physiological stress or by the African bollworm, provided soil moisture and nutrients are not limiting. Thus, the early sown cotton (sown between the end of November and end of December) may lose its bottom crop, but can compensate later by producing a crop during the main rains in March-April. If bollworms attack later, then the early sown crop would have set its main crop and will therefore escape damage (Nyambo et al., 2003).;Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, spiders etc.;Direct control measures are spraying with neem spray or a;garlic-chilli;-onion-repellent and Bt. For more information on;Neem click here;. For information on;Bt click here;.;In Malawi and Zimbabwe, thresholds based on egg numbers have been used successfully in cotton since 1961. Spraying was recommended at an average of one egg per two plants in twice-weekly counts. In the Sudan Gezira, over two eggs or caterpillar per 18 plants, and in Australia two eggs per metre of row were used as thresholds (CABI, 2000). It has been argued that control thresholds based on damage are easier to use and more economical than those based on pest density. In the case of cotton, damaged buds are easier to detect and sample than either eggs or small caterpillars. Studies in Tanzania indicate that spraying at damage threshold of 10 to 20% would give adequate protection to the crop. Further fine-tuning of damage thresholds should be concentrated during the first four weeks of flowering when most of the damage by this pest occurs. (Kabissa, 1989).;Bollworms can also be removed by hand picking. This helps when their numbers are low and in small fields.",

Initially the nymphs are wingless, but wings develop gradually as the nymphs grow. \n\tThe nymphs are found together in the area where the eggs have been laid and later disperse to look for food. Both nymphs and adults feed on the bolls, but adults cause the most serious damage. They pierce through the boll and suck the seeds reducing germination capability and the quality of the seed oil and the cake. \n\t  \n\tFurthermore, they cause severe indirect damage by transmission of a fungus ( Nematospora  sp.), which leads to internal boll rot and stain of the lint with typical yellow colour, hence the name 'cotton stainers'.

The edible, a long horned grasshopper  Homorocoryphus nitidulus vicinus  ( Ruspolia differens ) has been reported to occasionally attack maize in Tanzania (Bohlen, 1973). This grasshopper attacks maize in the silking stage, arresting pollination. Other grasshoppers and locust attack maize from the mid-whorl stage to maturity, and may consume every part of the plants. Attacks vary in severity from location to location.",

Other natural enemies include ants, parasitic flies, assassin bugs,;predator;y wasps, birds, lizards, snakes, frogs, and;fungi;. Robber flies are a major;predator;of grasshoppers.;Domesticated poultry (e.g. chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, geese, and ducks) and wild birds are good for keeping grasshopper populations in check. However, birds may damage the plants too. To avoid this enclose the birds in wire fencing along the perimeter so that they can prey on visiting grasshoppers while staying out of the crop.;Ensure the ground is covered with crops, grass or mulch. This is reported to reduce grasshopper numbers since they prefer laying eggs on bare soil.;Catch grasshoppers by hand or with a butterfly net. Catching them in the early morning is easier, as they are less active in the mornings.;Dig or cultivate the land before planting to expose the eggs to;predator;s and to the sun.;Whenever necessary spray;biopesticides;. Neem extracts act as antifeedant (grasshoppers stop feeding when exposed to neem products) and affect development of grasshoppers. For more information on neem for control of grasshoppers link to section of grasshoppers in cassava datasheet. IITA (the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture) researchers and partners have developed an environmental friendly biopesticide \"Green Muscle\" based on a naturally occurring fungus strain indigenous to Africa (;Metarhizium anisopliae;). This fungus is deadly to locusts and grasshoppers but reportedly does not damage plants, animals- or people. Typically 70 to 100 percent mortality rates were obtained after 8 to 28 days of application.;www.iita.org;.",

Crop losses caused by this pest can be severe, ranging from 50 to 100% of berries attacked if the pest is not controlled. The adult is a tiny (about 1.5 to 2.5 mm long), cylindrical blackish beetle. The females (1.4 to 1.6 mm) penetrate into mature green or red berries, usually from the tip and lay eggs within the beans. Female beetles fly from tree to tree to lay eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the beans, rendering them unsuitable for commerce or greatly lowering their quality. The white, legless grubs have a brown head. They feed by tunnelling in the tissues of the beans destroying them. Pupation takes place in the berry. Symptoms of attack are one or more small round holes near the apex of large green or ripe berries. The damaged beans, which have a distinct blue-green staining contain up to 20 grubs. Female beetles also attack young berries. Coffee berry borer damage predisposes the coffee bean to fungal infection and hence  contamination  with mycotoxins (food poison). Reasons for the infestation with coffee berry borer can be: the plantation is at a too low altitude, too much shade or that there are abandoned or infested plantations nearby. Infestations are carried over between peaks of fruiting by breeding in over-ripe berries left on the tree or fallen to the ground.",

In humid climates infection may reach more than 50%, and is probably the most significant natural control agent of the coffee berry borer. This fungus is used, alone or in combination with neem products, in several countries in South America for control of this pest. The fungus is easy to produce at a commercial scale, but it is difficult to apply (it must infect the adult borer before it bores into the berries), and its effectiveness is affected by the weather. For instance, in Colombia, where this fungus is widely used, much;B.bassiana;is being produced on farms and by small enterprises using simple technology. This fungus is also produced at industrial-scale by private companies (Smith and Bellotti, 1996; Depieri et al, 2005).;Proper and timely pruning accompanied by desuckering.;Field hygiene: A complete harvest and collection of all affected coffee berries on trees as well as dropped berries on the ground; destroy infested berries by burning, deep burying or rapid drying on trays.;Reduce shade on coffee. Heavy shade and/or inadequately pruned coffee cause unfavourable conditions for the natural enemies of the berry borer.;Pick berries at least fortnightly during fruiting peaks and at least monthly during other times.;Sacks or sheets should be spread on the ground to prevent berries from being lost in the mulch.",

The soft green scales are common but minor pests of Arabica coffee. More serious on transplanted seedlings during the first 2 years in the field. The yellowish to greenish flat oval scales are about 5 mm in length. They prefer to attack green wood and leaves, and usually appear as rows of flat oval green scales along main leaf vein and near tips of green shoots. Soft green scales produce large amounts of honeydew. This honeydew attracts ants, which while tending the scales protect them from their natural enemies. The sticky honeydew covers the leaves and sooty mould develops on it. As a result leaves appear black and sticky. Too dry microclimate favours infestation with soft green scale.",

The parasitic fungus;Cephalosporium (Verticillium) lecanii;is particularly effective in the rainy season when it can kill large colonies of the green coffee scale in a short period of time.;Control of soft green scale is possible indirectly by controlling ants by banding the tree stump. This keeps the attending ants away and allows natural enemies to clean up the infestation. The band should be at least 15 cm wide.

The mealybugs attack the roots where they usually live in association with a fungus ( Polyporus  sp.), which forms a crust over the mealybugs. Seedlings and very young trees are often free of the fungus. Attacked trees show wilting yellow leaves as if suffering from moisture stress. When affected trees are uprooted, the roots are stunted and encased in brown fungus. When the fungus is pealed off, the white mealybugs can be seen. \n\t  \n\tDamage is more prominent in dry conditions. The pest is associated with poorly established coffee. Severe infestation may lead to loss of quality, failure of berries to ripen and overbearing and die-back. Identical mealybugs have been reported on  Solanum  spp.,  Combretum  spp. and  Indigofera  spp. The root mealybug is also known as the citrus mealybug.

It is also claimed that citrus mealybug can be controlled by increasing the shade in plantations and that this was undesirable for Robusta coffee but suitable for Arabica at high altitudes. Good results were obtained by providing three covers, one above the other, of Leucaena, Erythrina and Albizia, or with Leucaena and Albizia only. It is further suggested that because the insect infests mainly the flowers and pods of  L. glauca , other shade trees that seldom flower, such as  L. pulverulenta (L. leucocephala),  or a sterile hybrid of  L. glauca  and  L. glabrosa  should be planted.",

It reproduces throughout the year and it reaches peak densities during the dry season. Mealybugs are dispersed by wind and through planting material.   The cassava mealybug strongly prefers cassava and other  Manihot  species; other host crops and wild hosts are only marginally infested. It sucks sap at cassava shoot tips, on the lower surface of leaves, and on stems. During feeding the mealybug injects a toxin into the cassava plant causing deformation of terminal shoots, which become stunted, resulting in compression of terminal leaves into \"bunchy tops\". The length of  internodes  is reduced, and stems are distorted. When attack is severe plants die, starting at the plant tip, where most mealybugs are found.   Mealybug attack results in leaf loss and poor quality planting material (stem cuttings) due to dieback and weakening of stems used for crop propagation. Tuber losses have been estimated up to 80%. The pest-induced defoliation reduces availability of healthy leaves, which are consumed as leafy vegetables in most of West and Central Africa. After the pest cripples plant growth, weed and erosion sometimes lead to total destruction of the crops. In general, yield losses depend upon age of plant when attacked, length of dry season, severity of attack and general conditions of the plant. Mealybug damage is more severe in the dry than in the wet season.   The cassava mealybug was accidentally introduced to Africa from South America. After the first reports in the 1970s, the insect became the major cassava pest within a few years and spread rapidly through most of the African cassava belt. The outbreak led to famine in several countries where cassava is a staple crop and particularly important in times of drought. In an attempt to control this pest natural enemies, mainly parasitic wasps and ladybird beetles, were introduced from South America.   The most effective has been the parasitic wasp ( Apoanagyrus  (= Epidinocarsis )  lopezi ), which has kept this mealybug at low levels, resulting on significant reduction of yield losses in most areas in Africa (Neuenschwander, 2003).",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Plant early in the rainy season to allow the cassava plants a good growth before the dry season. Strong plants are more likely to withstand pest attacks.;Use soil amendments and mulch to avoid moisture stress in sandy or poor soils. Mealybug numbers are higher on cassava grown on poor, sandy soils, and may cause damage in spite of the presence of natural enemies.;Avoid using infested plant material. Before planting cutting can be treated with hot water [by immersing them in heated water (mixing equal volumes of boiling and cold water) for 5-10 minutes just before planting] to kill all insects/mites and to avoid transfer into the newly planted field. For more information on;Hot water treatment click here.;Avoid using pesticides on crops surrounding cassava fields. Although, no pesticides are used on cassava in Africa, insecticide drift from neighbouring fields may affect natural enemies that keep mealybugs and other pests under control.;Use of manure or other fertilisers can result in a reduction in the mealybug population because improved nutrition results in the production of larger parasitoid wasps with higher fertility levels. Mulch and fertilizer use also enhances the antibiotic properties of cassava against mealybug infestation.",

Adult females attain a size of 0.8 mm. They appear as yellowish green specks to the naked eye. They occur on the lower surface of young leaves, green stems and auxiliary buds of cassava. Damage initially appears as yellowish \"pinpricks\" on the surface of young leaves.   Symptoms vary from a few chlorotic spots to complete  chlorosis . These symptoms are somehow similar to African cassava mosaic disease, and should not be confused. Heavily attacked leaves are stunted and become deformed. Severe attacks cause the terminal leaves to die and drop, and the shoot tip looks like a \"candle stick\". Green spider mites are major pests in dry season. Severe mite attack results in 20-80 % loss in tuber yield.   Predator y mites (mainly  Typhlodromalus aripo  and  T. manihoti ) introduced from South America, the home of the cassava green mite, have given effective control of the cassava green mites in Africa (Yaninek and Hanna, 2003).",

Nymphs are black with yellow markings on the body, legs and antenna and wing pads. Female grasshoppers lay many eggs just below the surface of the soil in the shade under evergreen plants, usually outside cassava fields. Eggs are laid in masses of froth, which harden to form sponge-like packets, known as egg pods, which look like tiny groundnut pods. Eggs start to hatch at the beginning of the main dry season.   Grasshoppers attack a wide range of crops mainly in the seedling stage. They feed on cassava plants, chewing leaves and stems and may cause defoliation and debark stems. This is particularly severe in fields next to the bush when the dry season is prolonged.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Hand pick grasshoppers. This is feasible in small plots.;Locate and dig egg-laying sites to expose and destroy the eggs before they start to hatch early in the dry season. However, egg pod destruction has to be done over a wide area in the wet season in order to be effective. This will require participation of farmers on many neighbouring farms. If only one neighbour destroys the eggs in his/her farm, the grasshoppers will later invade the farm from the neighbouring farms and bushes.;When available, use;biopesticides;. IITA researchers and partners have developed an environmental friendly biopesticide \"Green Muscle(r)\". It is based on a naturally occurring;fungus;strain indigenous to Africa (Metarhizium anisopliae) which is deadly to locusts and grasshoppers but reportedly does not damage other insects, plants, animals, or people. Typically 70 to 100% mortality rates were obtained after 8 to 28 days of application (;www.iita.org;). The bioinsecticide \"Green Muscle(r)\" is effective in grasshopper management in outbreak situations. However, it is costly and currently, it is only available in South Africa and West Africa.;Use neem extracts. Neem protects cassava from grasshopper damage. It acts as antifeedant (grasshoppers stop feeding when exposed to neem products) and affects development of the grasshoppers (Nicol et al, 1995; Olaoifa and Adenuga, 1988).;In Nigeria, the following neem products have given good control of Z. variegatus on cassava: 1.)

The spiralling whitefly ( Aleurodicus dispersus ) was reported as a new pest of cassava in West Africa in the early 90s. The adults and nymphs of this whitefly occur in large numbers on the lower surfaces of leaves covered with large amount of white waxy material. Females lay eggs on the lower leaf surface in spiral patterns (like fingerprints) of white material secreted by the female. This whitefly sucks sap from cassava leaves. It excretes large amounts of honeydew, which supports the growth of black sooty mould on the plant, causing premature fall of older leaves.   The  tobacco whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) transmits the  African cassava mosaic virus , one of the most important factors limiting production in Africa.

The armoured scales are the most serious pests. The most important  armoured scales  attacking citrus are the  red scale  ( Aonidiella aurantii ),  the mussel purple scale  ( Lepidosaphes beckii ), and  the circular scale  ( Chrysomphalus aonidum ). The most important  soft scales  are  the soft brown scale  ( Coccus hesperidum ) and  the soft green scale  ( Coccus viridiis  or  C. alpinus ).   Female scales have neither wings nor legs. Females lay eggs under their scale. Some species give birth to young scales directly. Once hatched, the tiny scales, known as crawlers, emerge from under the protective scale. They move in search of a feeding site and do not move afterwards. They suck sap on all plant parts above the ground. Their feeding may cause yellowing of leaves followed by leaf drop, poor growth, dieback of branches, fruit drop, and blemishes on fruits. Leaves may dry when heavily infested, and young trees may die.   Soft scales excrete honeydew, causing growth of sooty mould. In heavy infestations fruits and leaves are heavily coated with sooty mould turning black. Heavy coating with sooty mould reduces  photosynthesis . Fruits contaminated with sooty mould loose market value. Ants are usually associated with soft scales. They feed on the honeydew excreted by soft scales, preventing a build-up in sooty moulds, but also protecting the scales from natural enemies. Armoured scales do not excrete honeydew.",

      "pest_description": "Citrus bud mite ( Aceria sheldoni )   It is a tiny, worm-shaped, creamy white mite. It has only two pair of legs, and is hardly visibly without a magnifying glass. These mites occur in protected places such as under the bracts of buds. They attack the growing points of the twigs, causing malformation of the young leaves and flower buds. As a consequence, the growth of the trees is retarded. The fruit set can be seriously reduced and infested fruit may be malformed. Bud mites are more abundant during the hot season. Commonly found in developing and leaf buds. Damage under the bracts causes the death of the buds. Flower bud development is reduced, growth is retarded, branches become stunted and deformed, and rosette-shaped leaves are formed. The fruits, particularly in lemons are deformed. Almost all deformed fruits fall off at an early stage of development. Even light infestations may cause damage and control measures should be applied on time and regularly. Spots decrease the market value of the fruit and provide entry for fungal infection. Damage fruits loose moisture rapidly and do not keep well. Infestation on ripe fruits causes light yellow or silver discolouration. These mites attack all citrus species, but damage is usually worst in lemons. Damaged fruit could drop prematurely or assume abnormal shapes. The juice content of damaged fruit is significantly lower than that of normal fruit.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "The bud mites are not well controlled by natural enemies, and use of;biopesticides;is necessary for their management.;Sulphur at a concentration of 2% controls both the rust and bud mites. However, sulphur kills also beneficial mites and may disrupt the natural control of other potential citrus pests. Sulphur must not be used at a temperature exceeding 30degC. A 4 week interval must be maintained between sulphur and oil sprays. No other pesticides or mixtures may be added to sulphur.",

Although they do not damage the trees, they are associated to honeydew-producing insects such as soft scales, aphids, whiteflies,  blackflies  and mealybugs. \n\tNatural enemies often keep these insects under control; however, ants feeding on the honeydew give them indirect protection by disturbing natural enemies. As a result numbers of these honeydew producing insects, and indirectly other pests such as  armoured  scales, may rise to damaging levels. \n\t  \n\tAnt management does not imply eradication of all ants. There are many different types of ants in citrus orchards. Many of them are important  predator s of other insects, including pests of citrus. Some of the species that could be a problem due to their association with honeydew-producing insects (e.g. the big headed ant  Pheidole   megacephala  and the pugnacious ant,  Anoplolepis   custodiens  are also beneficial preying on a variety of insects, and are valuable  predator s on the ground.

In addition, they should be checked regularly for efficiency. Sticky bands (strips) soon become non-adhesive in dusty and windy conditions. Moreover, over time insects get stuck to the bands clogging them and forming bridges, which the ants can cross. Therefore regular applications of the sticky substances are needed.;Sticky substances (e.g. grease) may burn the bark, particularly, in young trees under direct sunlight. Therefore, it should not be applied directly to the trunks, but using polyurethane stripes as a base.",

These ants are present in many countries in Africa. They are common in the coastal regions in East Africa. \n\tThey built nests on trees by joining leaves with silk produced by the larvae. These ants are very active moving on the trees and on the ground in search of food. They are highly voracious feeding on a large range of insects visiting the trees, and are important in controlling many insect pests in fruit trees and coconut palms. In spite of these benefits, weaver ants are considered by some as a pest due to their aggressiveness combined with painful bites, which makes fruit picking difficult, and to their association with honeydew-producing insects. They can foster the build-up of these insect pests, but it has been observed that they do kill some of them when the amount of honeydew produced by these insects is bigger than the amount required by the colony of weaver ants. \n\t  \n\tThe benefits provided by  predator y ants feeding or deterring insect pests must be outweighed against the damage they may cost indirectly. As a whole weaver ants are considered beneficial. They have been used actively in China for the control of citrus pests for centuries (Way and Khoo, 1992).

      "pest_description": "Nematodes   More than 40 nematode species have been associated with citrus worldwide. The economically important species are the citrus nematode ( Tylenchulus semipenetrans ) and the burrowing nematode ( Radopholus similis ).   1) The citrus nematode  (T. semipenetrans) It causes a slow decline of citrus trees. Affected trees show reduced vigour, small yellow leaves, defoliation, die-back of twigs, and small fruits. The citrus nematodes are ectoparasitic and sedentary. Only females are parasitic on roots. They are found on the surface of fibrous roots under debris-covered egg masses embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The life cycle, from egg to egg, is completed within 6-8 weeks at temperatures of 24-26degC. Optimal reproduction occurs at 28-31degC. Soil salinity increases the population density of citrus nematode. In affected orchards, populations of the nematode are concentrated in upper soil layers. Movement of plant material and soil is responsible for the spread of the nematode. Also agricultural implements and water (irrigation or rain) spread the nematode in a citrus orchard.   2) The \"burrowing nematode\"  (Radopholus similis) It is called \"burrowing nematode\" on account of the cavities and tunnels it produces in the root tissues. Symptoms are generally present on groups of trees that increase in number with time, hence, the name, spreading decline. Symptoms are much more severe than in the case of  T. semipenetrans  and the spread is much quicker. Affected trees show fewer and smaller leaves and an abundance of dead twigs and branches. Trees wilt during periods of lack of moisture but generally the trees are not killed. It is an endoparasitic and migratory. Two distinct races of the nematode are known: the banana and citrus race. The former is known to attack banana roots but not citrus. The citrus race attacks bananas and citrus. The life cycle requires 18-21 days at 24-26degC, the optimum temperature being 24degC. Burrowing nematodes migrate through roots and from root to root to feed. The nematodes are rarely found in the top 10 cm of the soil, highest populations being between 30 and 180 cm. Primary spread is thorough propagating infested seedlings.",

Eggs are laid on the lower surface of young leaves. The young stages resemble soft scale insects and have a woolly appearance.

The butterfly is black with yellow markings on the wings, and has a wingspan of about 10 cm. They are common during the rainy season. Female butterflies lay whitish, grey eggs mainly on the tender terminal twigs and leaves. The caterpillars are white-brown, or green in colour. Most spines disappear as the caterpillar grows. Young caterpillars are brownish with white patches and are spiny. They resemble fresh bird droppings. Older caterpillars are green with some light markings and two eye-like spots at both sides of the front part of the body. When disturbed caterpillars shoot out a fleshy, forked retractable organ, through a slit behind the head, which gives off a repulsive smell.   Fully grown caterpillars are about 5 cm long. Caterpillars feed specially on the new growth of citrus trees. They can cause extensive damage to young trees, especially in citrus nurseries where their feeding can cause complete defoliation of the plant.",

Adult thrips have characteristic wings; the transparent wings have a fringe of hairs around the outside edge standing out in the same plane as the wing. The tiny eggs are laid just into the plant tissue on the pseudostem or where 2 fruits touch. The nymphs hatch after 7 or 8 days, are pale yellow or white in colour and often have a black globule of excrement at the end of the abdomen. The larval stage lasts about 10 days after which the nymphs move down into the soil to pupate. Adults emerge after a further 7 to 10 days.   The banana silvering thrips is found in tropical and subtropical regions, they are polyphagous and particularly found on bananas. They feed on the skin of the fruit causing silvering patches (hence the common name of the insect), which turn brown and may cover the whole fruit and deep longitudinal cracks may appear as a result.",

The direct damage caused by aphids sucking the plant sap is negligible. However, they are important pests as vectors of the virus causing the bunchy-top disease. Large colonies of aphids can occur around the base of pseudostems, down to 7-8 cm below the soil surface. Dense colonies can also occur between the sheath of outer leaf and pseudostem. During drought, aphids seek sheltered locations on the plant. In dull and humid weather, however, aphids may spread to foliage generally, and to the bases of maturing hands of fruit and all over the hands of young fruit. Colonies of  P. nigronervosa  are attended by ants, which feed on the large quantity of honeydew produced. Many species of ant are involved worldwide. Stechmann et al. (1996) described how ant-attendance reduced the density of indigenous  predator s of  P. nigronervosa  considerably, which has implications for biological control (Wellings et al., 1994).

Their feeding may cause stunted growth and premature ageing of the plants. \n\t  \n\tGrubs of  weevils  live in the soil feeding on roots or may bore into the stem of the bean plant causing swellings or galls, as is the case of the  striped bean weevil . Plants attacked by grubs of this weevil show stunted growth and may die. The stem of the plant breaks easily during harvesting (see more below).",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Practice post harvest tillage to expose the grubs in the soil to the sun heat and to;predator;s.;Rotate beans with non-host plants such as maize or sunflower to break the development cycle of the pest.;Delay sowing, where practicable, to allow the crop to escape from high populations.;Apply neem; it has been shown to reduce flea beetle numbers and damage.",

      "pest_description": "Striped bean weevil ( Alcidodes leucogrammus )   \n\tSeveral species of snout weevils are commonly found feeding on bean leaves. Adult weevils chew the edges of the leaves cutting circular discs. Grubs of weevils live in the soil feeding on roots or may bore into the stem of the bean plant causing swellings or galls, as is the case of the striped bean weevil. \n\t  \n\tThe adult of the striped bean weevil is 10-15mm long, dark brown in colour with whitish to yellowish longitudinal stripes. The females lay eggs in the soil near bean plants. Emerging grubs bore and feed inside the stem, causing  canker ous swelling or galls. Fully-grown grubs are white, about 10mm long, have no less and are C-shaped. Pupation occurs in an earthen cell attached to the plant. Plants attacked by grubs of this weevil show stunted growth, lodging, and eventually may die. The stem of the plant breaks easily during harvesting. \n\tIn Kenya, striped bean weevil only occurs occasionally, and to a minor extent and control measures are usually not required. \n\t  \n\tBeetles can be collected manually and destroyed. Plants damaged by the grubs can be removed and the grubs destroyed.",

Damage is most severe when mites attack young plants. Mite damage may be particularly severe during the dry season.",
      "pest_what_to_do": "Avoid planting next to infested fields.;Avoid frequent use of broad-spectrum pesticides, particulary;pyrethroid;s; this may lead to spider mite outbreaks.;Use overhead irrigation or wash plants with a strong jet of water to knock off mites and to destroy their webs. Be sure to spray the underneath of the leaves. However, this should be done early in the day to allow the foliage to dry. Wetness of the foliage for an extended period is conducive to development of fungal diseases.",
