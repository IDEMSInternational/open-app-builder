A safe water storage container is one that is:\n\n* Strong and has a tightly fitting lid or cover\n* Have a tap or a narrow opening to release water (no more than three fingers)\n* Stable base so it does not tip over\n* Durable and strong so that it does not leak easily\n* Has a comfortable handle\n* And of course easy to clean",
