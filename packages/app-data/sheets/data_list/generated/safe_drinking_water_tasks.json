If using heat to disinfect, the water should be boiled and remain boiling for at least 10 minutes to make sure all pathogens are killed before use. Boiled water should be stored, handled carefully and consumed within 24 hours to avoid recontamination. If sunlight is used to disinfect small quantities of water, the bottles should be filled with pre-filtered, clear water and set out in the sun (usually on rooftops) for 6 hours.",
