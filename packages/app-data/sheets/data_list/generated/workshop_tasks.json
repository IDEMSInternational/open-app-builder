I would take out my anger on everyone at home, not only my teens but even my husband as well. They would run away when I came home, because they knew I would start yelling at them. \n\nLearning to take a pause and breathe was difficult at first, but every time I tried it, it helped me to calm down. Now my teens are no longer running away when I come home, and they actually listen better than when I used to shout at them!",
      "teen_testimonial_script": "Whenever I would do something wrong, my father would get so angry at me and beat me. He would not even listen to me, and I would get so angry as well at him and everyone else. \n\nNow, when he gets angry, he first takes a few deep breaths before he responds. It makes everyone calm down instead of causing a big fight.\n\nIt really helped me at home and at school, because even me I am no longer slashing everyone and I am no longer this moody person. When I feel really angry or stressed, I also take deep breaths like my father does. I am a different person.",
