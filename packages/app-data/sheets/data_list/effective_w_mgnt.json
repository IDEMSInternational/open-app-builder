      "heading": "Recycling",
      "description": "It's referred to as any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials, or substances whether for the original or other purposes.\n \nTo recycle is to use it again or to reuse waste material by converting it into something new. An example of recycling is when you return bottles, which are then processed into new glass products",
      "sub_section1": "<span><b>Why is Recycling Important?</b></span><span><br/>1. Protects Ecosystems and Wildlife<br/>When we recycle, we lessen disruption to the natural world. When we cut down fewer trees and forests, we are preventing harm to animals. By reducing disruption and damage to the natural world, we help preserve ecosystems and wildlife.<br/><br/>2. Conserves Our Natural Resources<br/>Some of the world’s natural resources are in short supply, and when we recycle, we help conserve these natural resources.<br/>When we recycle paper, we save forests and trees. When we recycle plastic, it takes up a lot of solid waste and can take centuries to break down. In addition to this, most plastic comes from fossil fuel hydrocarbons.<br/>Recycling metals reduces the need to extract new metal ore while recycling glass reduces our need for certain raw materials like sand.<br/><br/>3. Saves Energy<br/>Making products from recycled materials requires less energy than making them from new, raw materials. It takes much less energy to make products out of recycled materials than from raw materials. For example, recycling one glass bottle saves enough power to light a 100-watt light bulb for four hours.<br/><br/>4. Reduces the Need to Harvest New Materials<br/>When we recycle, it reduces our need to harvest raw materials. Our increasing demand for these raw materials also displaces people who live near forests or around river systems. When we recycle, we reduce the possibility of damaging someone else land or community.<br/><br/>5. Reduces Carbon Emissions<br/>Recycling takes up less energy, which reduces our carbon footprint and emissions. Reducing our carbon footprint helps minimize methane-release waste from landfill sites, which contributes to climate change<br/><br/>6. Saves Money<br/>Recycling waste is much cheaper than regular waste collection and disposal. The more we recycle, the more money we can save. Deposit returns can also help add financial incentives to recycle.<br/>Recycling can help protect the environment while conserving natural resources. It is critical to recycle and minimize the amount of waste we are putting into the atmosphere. Doing so can help save energy, reduce landfill waste, and protect our environment.<br/><br/>7. Brings People Together<br/>Recycling brings communities together and helps people raise money for schools, colleges, hospitals, and more. These recycling drives make towns and cities happier and cleaner.<br/><br/>8. Educates People About the Importance of Protecting the Environment<br/>When communities come together to raise awareness about recycling, it teaches people about the importance of protecting the environment and how to do so. Educating people about protecting the environment can help equip future generations with the knowledge and understanding they need to reduce pollution.<br/><br/>9. Creates Jobs<br/>Recycling creates new jobs every year. Jobs in recycling include sorters, drivers, mechanics, technicians, and more.<br/><br/>10. Reduces Incineration<br/>When we recycle, we reprocess materials to make new products, reducing the amount of waste sent for incineration.<br/></span>",
      "sub_section2": "<span><b>Steps to Recycling Materials</b></span><span><br/>Recycling includes the three steps below, which create a continuous loop, represented by the familiar recycling symbol.<br/><br/>Step 1: Collection and Processing<br/>There are several methods for collecting recyclables, including curbside collection, drop-off centers, and deposit or refund programs.<br/>After collection, recyclables are sent to a recovery facility to be sorted, cleaned and processed into materials that can be used in manufacturing. Recyclables are bought and sold just like raw materials would be, and prices go up and down depending on supply and demand in the United States and the world.<br/><br/>Step 2: Manufacturing<br/>More and more of today's products are being manufactured with recycled content. Common household items that contain recycled materials include the following:<br/>Newspapers and paper towels<br/>Aluminum, plastic, and glass soft drink containers<br/>Steel cans<br/>Plastic laundry detergent bottles<br/>Recycled materials are also used in new ways such as recovered glass in asphalt to pave roads or recovered plastic in carpeting and park benches.<br/><br/>Step 3: Purchasing New Products Made from Recycled Materials<br/>You help close the recycling loop by buying new products made from recycled materials. There are thousands of products that contain recycled content. When you go shopping, look for the following:<br/>1. Products that can be easily recycled<br/>2. Products that contain recycled content<br/><br/>Below are some of the terms used:<br/></span><span><b>Recycled-content product</b></span><span> - The product was manufactured with recycled materials either collected from a recycling program or from waste recovered during the normal manufacturing process. The label will sometimes include how much of the content was from recycled materials.<br/><br/></span><span><b>Post-consumer content -</b></span><span> Very similar to recycled content, but the material comes only from recyclables collected from consumers or businesses through a recycling program.<br/><br/></span><span><b>Recyclable product </b></span><span>- Products that can be collected, processed and manufactured into new products after they have been used. These products do not necessarily contain recycled materials. Remember not all kinds of recyclables may be collected in your community so be sure to check with your local recycling program before you buy.<br/><br/>Some of the common products you can find that can be made with recycled content include the following:<br/>* Aluminum cans<br/>* Car bumpers<br/>* Carpeting<br/>* Cereal boxes<br/>* Comic books<br/>* Egg cartons<br/>* Glass containers<br/>* Laundry detergent bottles<br/>* Motor oil<br/>* Nails<br/>* Newspapers<br/>* Paper towels<br/>* Steel products<br/>* Trash bags<br/></span>"

      "description": "Incineration features the combustion of wastes to transform them into base components, with the generated heat being trapped for deriving energy. Assorted gases and inert ash are common by-products.",
      "sub_section1": "Pollution is caused by varying degrees dependent on the nature of the waste combusted and the incinerator design. \nThe use of filters can check pollution. It is rather inexpensive to burn waste and the waste volume is reduced by about 90%. \nThe nutrient-rich ash derived from burning organic wastes can facilitate hydroponic solutions. \nHazardous and toxic wastes can be easily rid of by using this method. \nThe energy extracted can be used for cooking, heating, and supplying power to turbines. \nHowever, strict vigilance and due diligence should be exercised to check the accidental leakage of micro-level contaminants, such as dioxins from incinerator lines."

      "description": "It involves the decomposition of organic waste by microbes by allowing the waste to stay accumulated in a pit for a long period of time. \nThe nutrient-rich compost can be used as plant manure. However, the process is slow and consumes a significant amount of land. \nBiological reprocessing tremendously improves the fertility of the soil."

      "id": "disposal_p_gasification",
      "heading": "Plasma Gasification",
      "description": "Plasma gasification is an environment-friendly waste disposal method. \nIt is used to convert commodity recyclables extracted from municipal solid waste in landfill into energy. The carbon-based materials are exposed to high temperatures and converted to syn-gas, a gas that can either be directly combusted or further refined into chemicals and higher-grade fuels.\n The non-organic part of the waste is converted to slag–cooled, tightly bound solid waste which can be used in construction as a raw material. Industries that strive to achieve zero waste prefer this waste disposal method."
