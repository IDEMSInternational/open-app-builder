These can be small things, such as being on time for school, washing the dishes, or something they do with their friends..\n2.

Help them understand that these things take work and practice, just like the things they are already good at.\n4. Help your teen come up with things they will need to do to achieve this new thing they want to be great at.\n5. Break down the goal into smaller, achievable steps. Write down these smaller goals and encourage your teen to tick them off as they accomplish them.\n6. Celebrate each achievement and encourage your teen to keep working towards their bigger goal.",
