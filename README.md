# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
   This will be used to download the repository

2. Download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)   
   This is the programming language required to run the project. 
   We currently support any of the versions prefixed `v20.x.x` or `v22.x.x`

3. Download and Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)  
   This manages all 3rd-party code dependencies

## Installation

### Download the repo with binary assets

To download the repo into the current working directory, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/IDEMSInternational/open-app-builder.git
```

### Install required dependencies
Navigate to the newly cloned directory if you have not done so already:
```
cd open-app-builder
```

From the route of the project, run the following command to download and install the required dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
Note - you may have to do this from time to time when the code is updated

## Configuration
### Set Deployment
The app supports using different workspace or deployment configurations. These are stored in [.idems_app/deployments](./.idems_app/deployments)

To use an existing deployment, run the following script:
```
yarn workflow deployment set
```
If you have already imported or created a deployment, this will present an interactive list of deployments to select from.

If you have no available deployments, see [Deployment Documentation](https://idemsinternational.github.io/open-app-builder/developers/deployments/) for information about creating and configuring deployments.

## Running locally

### Start the local server

This will start a local server and serve the app in your browser on http://localhost:4200.
