I put <code>text-align: right</code> in the <code>parameter_list</code> column and it did nothing, but it did what I would have expected in the <code>style_list</code> column. Similarly, <code>style: large center</code> has an effect in the <code>parameter_list</code> column but not the <code>style_list</code> column.</p> <p>Asked on 10 February 2022</p> <p>The <code>parameter_list</code> takes only parameters that are specifically defined by us for every specific component. As such, these are going to be pretty impossible for you to guess without documentation. For what it's worth, this file is the closest thing to documentation of those parameters that we have at the moment.  </p> <p>Instead, the <code>style_list</code> does indeed interpret CSS directly.
