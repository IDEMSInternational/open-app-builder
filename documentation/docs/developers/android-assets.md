# Android Assets

This page has been replaced by **[Native assets (Android & iOS)](native-assets.md)**.

Native assets (app icon and splash/launch screen) are now documented in a single page for both Android and iOS, using a logo + background colour approach. See [Native assets](native-assets.md) for configuration, workflow, and deprecated options.
